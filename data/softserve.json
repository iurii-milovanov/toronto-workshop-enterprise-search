OBH are a team of health outcomes data specialists including \nclinicians, developers, data scientists, NHS data analysts, economists, \nand product specialists. They all share a deep commitment to supporting \nsustainable healthcare by transforming the way healthcare measures and \nfunds success, to those things that matter to people.\n\nhttp://www.obhsense360.com/\n\n\nBusiness Challenge\n\nPatient outcomes can be measured in a number of ways. In some cases, clinical or \nadministrative data from healthcare services and providers can be used. However to capture a \npatient\u2019s voice, current standard practice requires an individual to feed back \u2018Patient-Reported \nOutcomes\u2019 (PROs), usually in the form of a written survey response. However, there are \nchallenges with this approach:\n\n \u2022 Response levels and frequency of data collection are usually very low, and drop off  \nover time\n\n \u2022 The data collected measures a point in time (usually in a single healthcare setting or care \nsilo) \u2013 we all have good and bad days and infrequent manually collected PRO surveys can\u2019t \ntake that into account\n\n \u2022 The feedback is entirely subjective and so only really relevant for the individual in question\n\nIn short, PRO surveys tend to be time-consuming, have poor completion rates, introduce bias, \nare episodic, and often very costly.\n\nOBH is using technology to radically disrupt existing approaches to PRO data collection, \ninterpretation and analysis. Specifically, in this instance, the question OBH wanted to answer \nwas; is it possible to continuously and passively measure patient-reported outcomes in people \nwith diabetes without having to resort to long, paper or online questionnaires?\n\nOBH chose to make use of the increasingly ubiquitous smartphone to continuously and \npassively measure data which could answer this question. The company wanted to create an \napp, OBH Sense 360, that could harvest data from the sensors that are already integrated into \nsmartphones. We know that people use their smartphones differently when they are sick or \nunhappy, so the OBH team wanted to see if they could capture how people use their phones, \nand correlate that with their outcomes.\n\nProject Description\n\nSoftServe was selected by OBH for its reputation for having extensive research capacity, as well \nas experience with complex projects that require both deep technical expertise and creativity.\n\nSoftServe started the build for the front and back end of a native Android application that \ncould both improve the collection of PRO data through a well-designed, usable interface, \nand also gather large volumes of unstructured sensor data passively in the background. The \nsensors in a smartphone measure everything from movement, how fast you walk, the way \nyou hold your phone, how often you use your phone and even the air temperature where an \nindividual is located.\n\nThe project was broken down into multiple phases including investigation, application \narchitecture, development & User Interface (UI), integration, and testing. The app itself was \nbuilt using an iterative \u2018agile scrum\u2019 methodology.\n\n2case study | Outcomes Based Healthcare Sense 360 App Harvests Data from Smartphone Sensors\n\nhttp://www.obhsense360.com/\n\n\nSoftServe elected to use Funf, the open sensing framework for Android to capture data from \nsensors. The unpredictability and complexity of the Funf framework contained some risks. \nChief among these being the sheer volume of unidentifiable and unstructured data recorded. \nHowever, due to the iterative approach taken in development, the SoftServe team had enough \ntime to investigate the issues and develop comprehensive solutions.\n\nThe SoftServe team presented regular status reports, and demonstrated new functionalities \nusing an Android emulator on a bi-weekly basis.\n\nSoftServe also worked to reduce memory and battery consumption for smartphones taking \npart in the project. This was achieved by carefully tuning the frequency with which sensors \nreported second-by-second data against the level of detail OBH needed.\n\nSoftServe also helped OBH to specify and implement the databases using cloud services \nprovided by Amazon Web Services in Europe and Parse.com in the US. This helped ensure all \ndata stored was fully encrypted and handled in line with data protection laws.\n\nOBH trialled the Sense360 app early in 2016, and is planning a pilot in the summer of 2016. \nThis will involve researchers analysing data collected to look for a relationship between \nthe survey answers and phone usage patterns. They will apply intelligent machine learning \nalgorithms to understand how diabetes impacts peoples\u2019 outcomes.\n\n3case study | Outcomes Based Healthcare Sense 360 App Harvests Data from Smartphone Sensors\n\n\n\nValue Delivered\n\nWithin the first two iterations, SoftServe completed more than 90 percent of the UI scope, and \nfor each following iteration new sensors were added to the application.\n\n\u201cWe knew that we needed a very experienced and strong team of technology experts, who \nare both analytical and innovative. We were happy to find this partnership with SoftServe,\u201d \nexplained Dr. Nasrin Hafezparast, CTO and Co-Founder OBH.\n\n\u201cSoftServe\u2019s active participation and partnership approach towards this project, whereby \nOBH supported SoftServe\u2019s technical delivery with specifications and research on outcomes \nmeasurement, has made the difference between an app which merely \u2018does the job\u2019, and one \nwhich is able to be sustainably deployed as a routine health tracking innovation.\u201d \n\nThe OBH Sense360 project is currently a research project, but the future of outcomes based \ncommissioning depends on finding a scalable, reliable and reproducible method of measuring \noutcomes that requires minimum user input. On an industry level it could revolutionise and \naccelerate the transition to value based healthcare, and for OBH it would provide an additional \nscalable source of revenue and position them as a leader in the industry.\n\n4case study | Outcomes Based Healthcare Sense 360 App Harvests Data from Smartphone Sensors\n\n\n\nABOUT US\n\nSoftServe is a global digital authority and consulting company, operating at \nthe cutting edge of technology.

It delivers fast, personalized \nexperiences to users on any device, browser, location, or connection,  \nand makes it possible to discover each user\u2019s browsing context and  \ntailor the app\u2019s content and optimization profile to meet the specific  \nneeds of the moment.\n\n\n\nBusiness Challenge\n\nThe client needed to implement an in-house Operation Intelligence platform but the leading \ntools on the market do not have the ability to quickly detect issues in system performance \nand security, so they approached SoftServe, renowned for its expertise in complex Big Data \nsolutions and architecture design methods, for help. It was also important that an Agile \napproach was used as innovation, expansion, continuous improvement and rapid time to \nmarket were the key drivers, forcing everyone in the team to constantly focus on results.\n\nBig Data Challenges\n\nThe project need to solve several challenges, including:\n\n \u2022 High Throughput\n \u2022 1 Billion messages per day\n\n \u2022 Large volume\n \u2022 Estimated 300 TB\n\n \u2022 Near-real time and batch processing at the same time\n \u2022 < 1 min event processing latency\n \u2022 < 3 sec query response time\n\n \u2022 Semi-structured data sources\n \u2022 Web Logs\n\nProject Description\n\nImportance of PoC (Proof-of-concept) in Big Data projects\n\nTechnical risks are an integral part of any Big Data project. In fact, high complexity and \nimmature technology is the current reality that software architects and engineers face. But \nbuilding a full-scale prototype is not realistic due to the high cost and time requirements. While \narchitecture analysis alone is insufficient to prove many important system properties such as \nperformance and scalability. Instead, MVP (minimum viable product), throw-away and vertical \nevolutionary prototypes help in areas that architecture analysis cannot sufficiently address.\n\nFor this project a throwaway prototype (also known as rapid prototypes or proof-of-concept) \nwas chosen to quickly evaluate the riskiest technology selections, and an MVP to get early \nfeedback from end users and updating the product roadmap accordingly.\n\n2case study | Big Data Web Analytics Platform on AWS for Yottaa\n\n\n\nAWS as an Environment for PoC\n\nWith no hardware to procure, and no infrastructure to maintain and scale, Amazon Web \nService is an extremely effective time-to-market accelerator and was the perfect platform for \nthis project, particularly as, at the early stages, the exact software and hardware requirements \nwere not immediately clear. Particular benefits of the platform were:\n\n1.The opportunity to experiment with software and hardware while looking for the appropriate \nsolution (the environment can be provisioned and unprovisioned in just a few clicks).\n2. Tight integration between S3 and EMR enabled a unique Hadoop cluster on demand \n(Amazon EMR) and resulted in significant cost savings. Hadoop itself has two functions, storing \nand computing, but with S3 fully covering storage, there was no need to keep the Hadoop \ncluster up and running when not utilizing the \u2018computing\u2019 function. And as the web logs were \nstored on S3, it was possible to terminate the Hadoop cluster without data loss and launch the \ncluster again only when required.\n\nElasticsearch as a Platform for Dashboarding\n\nDuring the discovery phase, SoftServe\u2019s Big Data experts suggested Elasticsearch as a  \nprimary data storage for real-time analytics. The goal was to implement near-real time \nscenarios with high query performance (< 3 sec) and minimum data latency (< 1 min) in  \na highly concurrent environment.\n\nThe PoC phase was important in order to mitigate performance risks when utilizing Aggregates \n- a new functionality in Elasticsearch - and focused primarily on three tasks:\n\nTask 1. Quickly populate Elasticsearch with log data, instead of full integration with existing \ninfrastructure which typically takes much longer.\n\nTask 2. Discover the optimal hardware and configuration for Elasticsearch and tune it for the \nrequired workload.\n\nTask 3. Create interactive visualization for testing and demos. \n\nThe SoftServe team utilized EMR and Elasticsearch-Hadoop driver for Task 1. Pig and Hive was \nused to parse and load log data from S3 into Elasticsearch (see diagram below) where each \nHive external table had been pointed to an Elasticsearch index.\n\nFor Task 2 (discover optimal hardware) the team experimented with different EC2 types \n(general purpose, storage optimized, compute optimized, etc.) and block storages (SSD and \nHDD drives, instance storages, EBS with provisioned IOPS, etc.). Performance and load tests \nshowed that the CPU was a bottleneck on the required workload, so finally compute optimize \ninstances (c4 model) was selected as a base EC2 instance type for the Elasticsearch cluster.\n\nFor Task 3, an initial version of the interactive dashboard using Kibana was created in less  \nthan a day.\n\n3case study | Big Data Web Analytics Platform on AWS for Yottaa\n\n\n\nFrom PoC to Production\n\nWhile some of SoftServe\u2019s Big Data experts were working on Elasticsearch evaluation using \nEMR as a processing engine and load data from S3 into Elasticsearch (ETL approach), others \nwere implementing Flume- >Kafka->Logs Consumers processing pipeline for near-real time \nscenario. Elasticsearch mappings (data model) was agreed at the beginning, allowing work to \ncommence on both Elasticsearch PoC and near real time scenario, in parallel. This enabled the \nMVP, and the pre-production system, to be created in a short timeframe.\n\nNext Steps\n\nAmazon EMR already supports Apache Spark, a powerful computing engine that can \nsupplement the Operation Intelligence platform by introducing stream processing through \nSpark Streaming and advanced analytics (Spark MLib), out-of-the-box. But now it fully  \nsupports Kafka Direct Approach, Spark has everything required for seamless integration  \nwith the system, so the SoftServe team can leverage all advantages of AWS for the future \nLambda Architecture.\n\nValue Delivered\n\nAWS proved to be an extremely effective time-to-market accelerator for the Operation \nIntelligence platform because no time was required for infrastructure deployment and \nconfiguration. The pay-as-you-go basis allows costs to be optimized and provides the flexibility \nto increase capacity over time depending on need.\n\nSoftServe have continued helping the client with implementation and technology advice. The \nfirst production version has been successfully released and the system is now evolving with \nnew features.\n\nSoftServe\u2019s Big Data accelerators, experienced team and effective cloud technologies along \nwith the client\u2019s strong product vision, were crucial to the project\u2019s success. The prototyping \napproach from PoC to MVP and to full-featured production, once again showed its \neffectiveness and allowed the agreed business and technical goals to be achieved.\n\n4case study | Big Data Web Analytics Platform on AWS for Yottaa\n\nhttps://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/new-apache-spark-on-amazon-emr/\n\n\nABOUT US\n\nSoftServe is a global digital authority and consulting company, operating at \nthe cutting edge of technology.

In early 2013, Kony, a fast growing next-gen mobile \nPaaS company, approached SoftServe with a serious set of \narchitecture and development challenges. An internal effort to \nrefactor and port their server technology to a cloud platform \nhad been stalled, and customer adoption for trials and platform \nusage was slowing down due to complexities with the existing \non-premises model.\n\nBusiness Challenge\n\nSoftServe engage with the Client company using an experienced \nteam of two architects; one for cloud systems and one for data \nwarehousing. This team met the initial deadline for a proof-of-\nconcept in just thirty days, and gained the confidence of the ISV \nclient to proceed at full speed with a general implementation.\n\nTo ensure the new Business Intelligence (BI) solution for the \nnext-generation Mobile PaaS is cost effective, high performing \nand scalable, the SoftServe Architecture team considered several \noptions for a new architecture and technology stack. A number \nof factors led the team to select TIBCO and AWS to meet the new \nPaaS platform reporting requirements:\n\nREPORTING AND ANALYTICS \nSOLUTION FOR KONY, NEXT-GEN \nMOBILE PAAS COMPANY\n\nJaspersoft\n\n\n\ncase study |    Reporting and Analytics Solution for Kony, Next-Gen Mobile PaaS Company 2\n\nTIBCO SOFTWARE AND AMAZON WEB SERVICES: UNIQUELY QUALIFIED \nFOR THE PROJECT\u2019S CLOUD, HIGH PERFORMANCE, AND TIME TO MARKET \nREQUIREMENTS\n\nCost Effectiveness\n\nWeb services and Multi-tenancy maximize savings in terms of infrastructure development \nand operational support. Tandem of JasperReports Server and Amazon Redshift have \nallowed building an extremely effective solution within sharedschema shared-db multi-\ntenancy scenario.\n\n\u2022 Capital Expenses. Fortunately, when the team started designing the solution, TIBCO \nannounced full support of Amazon Redshift. The combination of TIBCO and Amazon \nRedshift provided a number of benefits:\n\n\u2022 Amazon Redshift is an inexpensive data warehouse engine when compared to similar     \nofferings in the Cloud market. Pricing consists of $0.25 per hour with no commitments or \nupfront costs, or $1,000 per terabyte of compressed data per year for a 3 Year Reserved cluster. \nAs data compression is up to 90% for the column oriented storages, it allowed the team to host \na larger set of data for an excellent price. \n\n\u2022 TIBCO licensing does not limit the number of tenants, number of end users, or data size. \nCharging for a physical server only, it is very costeffective, and even more so with multi-tenancy \nby not requiring a separate server instance for each tenant.\n\n\u2022 Operational Expenses. TIBCO\u2019s multiple customer support options provide an \nopportunity to find the optimal price/value balance. Amazon Redshift is offered as a \nservice, with Amazon covering a significant portion of operational support efforts to \nkeep your software up and running.\n\nHigh Performance and Scalability\n\nThe target system criteria required a response time of less than 5 seconds per report. \nAmazon Redshift\u2019s column-oriented analysis and TIBCO\u2019s reporting and analytics platform \nexceeded these performance expectations.\n\nRedshift demonstrates excellent performance in a multitenancy scenario, due to Redshift \ndata distribution and sorting features. JasperReports Server\u2019s multi-tenancy out-of-the-box \nfeature requires minimal implementation efforts.\n\nIn addition, Redshift multi-node architecture allows scaling up to 1.6 petabytes of storage, \nfar beyond most typical use cases.\n\n\n\ncase study |    Reporting and Analytics Solution for Kony, Next-Gen Mobile PaaS Company 3\n\nSelf-Service Reporting\n\nThe term \u2018Self-Service\u2019 covers several aspects that are mainly associated with providing the \nend-user the ability to drag and drop business items to build custom metrics or custom \nreports. Such functionality was achieved primarily with the help of JasperReport Server\u2019s \nDomain, a metadata layer, which abstracts business items from the underlying physical \ndata structure:\n\n \n\n\u2022 Ad-hoc Reporting is an intuitive drag and drop report designer for nontechnical users. \nSuch functionality allows users to create custom data slices and reports and share them \nacross other users within the same organization (tenant).\n\n\u2022 Custom Metrics. JasperReports Server\u2019s Domain REST API enables automatic creation \nand management of a metadata layer for each tenant.\n\nEmbedded Reporting\n\nFor integrating reports with the other systems, the development team relied on TIBCO \napplication programming interfaces (APIs). TIBCO APIs are designed for easy access, rapid \nimplementation, and application-specific customization, providing the team significant \nflexibility for integration with the SoftServe-developed PaaS platform.\n\nThe SoftServe development team also took maximum advantage of the out-of-the-box \nfeatures to meet the demanding six-month timeto-market goal. \u201cTIBCO APIs, particularly \nRESTful services, allowed us to quickly and easily integrate reporting with the other \nservices running in the system, also we leveraged multiple features of TIBCO to accelerate \nour efforts, including builtin configuration capabilities, the import/export of repository, \ntools and components for ad-hoc reporting\u201d, said Taras Bachynskyy, SoftServe Data \nArchitect.\n\n\n\ncase study |    Reporting and Analytics Solution for Kony, Next-Gen Mobile PaaS Company 4\n\nUsing the deep set of middleware and thirdparty tools, the \nSoftServe architecture team was able to create an extremely cost-\neffective, highperformance, cloud-based reporting and analytics \nsolution for the next-generation PaaS by blending AWS and third-\nparty services. The architecture highlights include:\n\n\u2022 High-volume intra-platform messaging using Amazon SQS\n\u2022 Celery and Redis for distributed tasks management and \n\nmultiprocessing\n\u2022 Amazon Redshift and TIBCO Reporting Platform for data \n\nwarehousing and reporting\n\u2022 Integration with other SaaS based systems\n\nSOLUTION \nARCHITECTURE: \nBLENDING AWS \nPLATFORM \nSERVICES WITH \nTIBCO AND \nTHIRD-PARTY \nFRAMEWORKS \nTO BUILD A \nBEST-OFBREED \nSOLUTION\n\nEnd-user devices and back-end services send millions of messages into Amazon SQS \nQueues. Celery workers \u2013 a group of EC2 instances that asynchronously execute validation, \ntransformation and data loading tasks \u2013 processes these messages and loads them into \nAmazon Redshift through Amazon S3. The processing flow is organized into a chain of \ndistributed tasks managed by Celery workers and stored in Redis. Such architecture \nhas great scalability and high availability. Celery workers group continuously processes \nmessages into Redshift, so a user can analyze data in near real-time using JasperReports \nServer reports and ad-hoc views exposed through web portal UI.\n\n\n\ncase study |    Reporting and Analytics Solution for Kony, Next-Gen Mobile PaaS Company 5\n\nUltimately, the development team from SoftServe, led by two full time architects, delivered \nthe next-generation solution in an incredibly short period of time, through dedicated \nefforts, effective collaboration, and great ingenuity and innovation with the very latest \ntools and techniques in cloud-based software development.\n\n\u201cSoftServe has been TIBCO\u0300 s partner since 2013 and has profound knowledge of TIBCO\u0300 s \nofferings as well as our multiple customer support options. That makes SoftServe an \nideal partner able to recommend the optimal price/value balance to enhance system \nperformance and fine tune any TIBCO configuration that a company might use,\u201d said Paul \nKochanski, Global Channels Director TIBCO Jaspersoft.\n\n\n\nABOUT US\nSoftServe is a digital authority that advises and provides at the \ncutting-edge of technology.

Adding this custom \ncontrol and integrating with standard controls was surprisingly easy; the end result was a \nseamless integration of both.\n\nFor data integration, the team relied on Jaspersoft ETL. Powered by Talend, Jaspersoft ETL \nscales to the highest levels of data volumes and process complexity. It allows developers \nto graphically design, schedule and execute data movements and transformations with an \nintuitive user interface and short learning curve.\n\nResults \n\n\u2022 Lower development costs: SoftServe completed the project in just seven months with a \nteam of 25 people, lowering development costs by estimated 25 percent. \n\n\u2022 Faster project ramp-up: SoftServe built the core resource model rapidly in just three \nweeks instead of an estimated seven weeks. \n\n\u2022 Higher performance: SoftServe found that Jaspersoft delivered 30-35 percent faster \nprocessing on average, and 100 percent higher performance in some cases.\n\nFlexible, Dynamic Reporting\n\nWith JasperReports Server integrated with the network security solution, end users have \na webbased, self-service BI tool that\u2019s simple to use. They have both real-time and big-\npicture historical reporting to support rapid troubleshooting on infected computers or take \nproactive steps to prevent attacks in the future.\n\nThey also easily pull the reporting they need to show internal and external auditors how \nthe network is protected from the latest threats.\n\n\n\ncase study |    SoftServe Lowers Big Data Development Costs by 25 Percent with Jaspersoft 4\n\nThe Jaspersoft BI backend allows end users to choose from 35 pre-built reports to view in \nthe dashboard or schedule to be emailed in the format they choose. Or, they can customize \ntheir reports based on existing templates. In turn, they can evaluate network attacks in any \nway they choose, such as by IPs, devices, geography and more.\n\n\u201cThe reports are super flexible. End users can dynamically generate canned, ad hoc \nand scheduled reports with many inputs to choose from and ways to look at the data,\u201d \nZabavskyy said. \u201cThey can report on data from 20 different security devices in one place, \non the fly.\u201d\n\nSoftServe also finds that Jaspersoft\u2019s ease of use shortens the learning curve for end users. \nWith the easy-to-use tools in JasperReports Server and Jaspersoft iReport Designer, users \ncan easily follow Jaspersoft documentation to develop their own reports.\n\n\u201cPerformance was critical for us,\u201d Pavlyuk said. \u201cWe found that because the \nJasperReports Server performs the entire reporting cycle from parameters \nspecification to result export in one single Java virtual machine (JVM), we get \na significant performance improvement.nce improvement.\u201d\n\nHigher Big Data Performance with Lower Development Costs\n\nThe choice of Jaspersoft allowed SoftServe to deliver the performance its client demanded \nin less time and for lower cost. With a convenient integrated development environment \n(IDE) for reports, SoftServe built the core resource model for the project ramp-up in just \nthree weeks, instead of the expected seven weeks.\n\nComprehensive out-of-the-box functionality in Jaspersoft contributed to the project\u2019s \ncompletion in just seven months with a team of 25 people lowering development costs by \nan estimated 25 percent.\n\nWhen compared to solutions the firm has used on custom-built reporting engines, \nSoftServe found that Jaspersoft delivered 30-35 percent faster processing on average, and \n100 percent faster for some reports.\n\n\n\ncase study |    SoftServe Lowers Big Data Development Costs by 25 Percent with Jaspersoft 5\n\nThe experienced at SoftServe\u2019s team also values Jaspersoft\u2019s upgrade stability, which \ntranslates to fast, low-cost migrations. \u201cThe API is strictly maintained from version to \nversion by Jaspersoft, so migration had almost no impact on development,\u201d Pavlyuk said. \n\u201cIt took just two to three days for two engineers to rebuild the packages.\u201d\n\nReport performance on terabytes of data is excellent, and development/maintenence \nefforts were low. \u201cWith Jaspersoft, we were able to satisfy our client\u2019s strict performance \nrequirements.\n\nOur experience has been very good and we look forward to continuing to work with \nJaspersoft on future projects,\u201d Kolodchak said.\n\nSMS #1\n\nDevices\n\nReporting Server\n\nSystem \nAdministration\n\nData WarehouseDevices\n\nSMS #N\n\n\n\nABOUT US\nSoftServe is a digital authority that advises and provides at the \ncutting-edge of technology.

However,  \nwith great power comes great responsibility\u2014building  \na mobile healthcare application requires a totally  \ndifferent range of requirements and overall solution  \ndevelopment approach. From reference architecture  \nand UI design to data security and regulatory  \ncompliance, here is a detailed guide to develop  \na mobile solution for healthcare. \n\nSTEP-BY-STEP GUIDE TO \nDEVELOPING HEALTHCARE \nMOBILE SOLUTIONS \n\n\n\ncase study Step-By-Step Guide to Developing Healthcare Mobile Solutions 2\n\nReference Architecture \n\nPresentation Layer \nDesigning for an effective user experience can be critical to the success of an application. \nCarry out usability studies, surveys, and interviews to understand what users require  \nand expect from the application, and design with these results in mind.\n\nBusiness Layer \nWhen designing a business logic subsystem, the goal is to minimize the complexity  \nand decouple components by separating responsibilities into different areas of concerns \nto promote maintainability, reusability, and testability. For example, business processing, \nbusiness workflow, and business entities all represent different areas of concern.  \nWithin each area, the components designed should focus on the specific area  \nand should not include code related to other areas of concern. \n\nCommunication \nCommunication will often involve sensitive data so it is important to design for security.  \nAt the same time, designing an effective communication subsystem is also important  \nfor reliability, performance, power, and traffic analytics. \n\nData Access \nDesigning the application to use a separate data access subsystem is important for \nmaintainability and extensibility. The data access subsystem should be responsible  \nfor managing connections with the data source and for executing commands against  \nthe data source. Depending on the business entity design, the data access subsystem  \nmay have a dependency on business entities; however, the data access subsystem  \nshould never be aware of business processes or workflow components. \n\nData Processing \nIt is often necessary to transform data to some other form or format\u2014encrypt/decrypt, \ncompress/decompress, parse/generate JSON, etc. \n\nSensors \nMobile device sensors can be used to measure motion (accelerometer, gyroscope),  \nposition (proximity, magnetic field), and various environmental conditions (light, \ntemperature, or humidity). \n\nSystem Services \nMobile platforms allow access to some system services\u2014make a phone call, send SMS,  \nget or update information in system address book, calendar, and so on. \n\n\n\ncase study Step-By-Step Guide to Developing Healthcare Mobile Solutions 3\n\nMonetizing \nThere are many different options to make money from the mobile application.  \nConsider the following guidelines when designing monetizing: \n\n\u2022 Choose the distribution type for your application\u2014business to business (B2B),  \nin-house distribution within the organization, or public market distribution. \n\n\u2022 Choose billing model\u2014free, premium (pay for app), trial (upgrade to premium), \nfreemium (pay for in-app items), subscriptions, or monetize the app through  \ntargeted advertising. \n\n\u2022 To prevent malicious users from redistributing paid content, do not bundle  \nit in the application bundle, Instead, download it from the remote server.\n\n\u2022 Verify the purchase state of unlocked content whenever users access it.\n\u2022 Obfuscate your in-app billing code.\n\nCross-Cutting \nThere are functionalities and components that can be found across different  \nmobile application subsystems, such as security, error handling, logging, and other. \n\nDevelopment Options \n\nWhen it comes to development effort, focus on these key considerations: \n\n\u2022 Development speed\n\u2022 Available programming expertise\n\u2022 UX (responsiveness, performance) \n\u2022 Data persistence (offline) & security \n\u2022 Access to native device functionality \n\u2022 Toolset and documentation \n\u2022 Cross platform support \n\u2022 Debugging and troubleshooting \n\u2022 Timely access to OS innovations \n\u2022 Deployment\u2014distribution and maintenance \n\u2022 Additional considerations\u2014device fragmentation challenges,  \n\nmonetization, market visibility, etc. \n\nIt\u2019s important to remember that even though in theory the following frameworks  \nfacilitate \u201cbuild once and deploy on multiple devices,\u201d in practice the apps require  \ntweaking for each platform. It is highly recommended to plan on 20-25% additional effort \non each platform once the base app is built. For big applications, it can take up to 40-50%.  \nSome device functions may already be supported by the cross-platform frameworks  \nso a careful analysis is needed to determine the additional effort required when  \ndeveloping on multiple platforms. Most cross-platform frameworks let you build  \nplug-ins for device features not supported by the platform itself. However, plug-ins  \nshould be developed for each platform, which adds to the overall effort. \n\n\n\ncase study Step-By-Step Guide to Developing Healthcare Mobile Solutions 4\n\nUX Security Performance Battery Life Data Storage\n\nDealing with DataA uthenticationC oncurrency\n\nInput validationScreen Size &\n\n \nOrientation\n\nPersonalize\n\nSocial\n\nPop-ups\n\nNavigation\n\nAccessibility\n\nApplication \nsandboxing\n\nCryptography\n\nSystem & custom\npermissions\n\nAudit trail\n\nRemote data\nwipe out\n\nSpecialized\nframeworks\n\nUI layout perform\nance optimization\n\nMonitor\nbattery level\n\nMonitor\nconnectivity status\n\nLocal storage\n\nExternal storage\n\nPublic cloud &\nprivate backend\n\nPreferences\n\nLocal database\n\nAlso, mind potential vendor lock-in. Cross-platform frameworks take time to support new \nfunctionality that becomes available when a new OS version or device model is released. \nNote\u2014there is also no guarantee that it will be supported. In contrast, native apps can \nleverage new capabilities immediately. \n\nPatterns \n\nThe following mind map diagram shows some of the most important pattern categories \nand the actual patterns for these categories.\n\nMobile Application Security\n\nSecurity is a very important quality attribute of good, large scale, and mission critical \nmobile software solutions. SoftServe strongly advises that security engineering best \npractices be embedded within the implementation lifecycle. \n\nAccording to the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), embedding  \nsecurity into an application produces 30 times the savings as opposed to trying  \nto bolt security on after the application is developed. Other experts put it at 100  \ntimes the savings. Insecure applications can lead to security breaches. The practice \n shows that up to 90% of vulnerabilities could be determined during code and design \nreview against the top 10 common vulnerabilities, therefore, SoftServe includes  \nregular security code review in the development process. \n\n\n\ncase study Step-By-Step Guide to Developing Healthcare Mobile Solutions 5\n\nPlaning Design Build Test Deploy\n\nSecurity \nObjectives\n\nSecurity Design\nGuidelines\n\nSecurity Deploy-\nment Review\n\nThreat Modelling\n\nSecurity \nDesign Review\n\nDeployment\nChecklists\n\nSecurity Testing\n\nOWASP Top10\n\nSANS/MITRE Top 25\n\nSecurity\nCode Review\n\nOWASP Code\nReview Guide\n\nSecurity\nChecklists\n\nStatic Code\nAnalyzers\n\nTaking into consideration the possibility of future exposure for the designed solution  \nand growing user base, SoftServe recommends effective security engineering practices, \nbuilt in conformance with industry recognized and widely adopted Open Web Application \nSecurity Project (OWASP) organization system wide and specific recommendations  \nfrom Microsoft for application security. \n\nThe following diagram depicts SoftServe\u2019s security engineering practices throughout \nASDLC.\n\nIncorporating security into Agile development, allows for the creation of applications  \nthat are secure by design\u2014not by chance or circumstance. The proposed solution  \nprovides a range of benefits:\n\n1. Effort benefit\u2014the effort to fix the vulnerabilities in the early stage of the system \ndevelopment lifecycle (SDLC) process is much less than the later stage of the process. \nOnce the code is complete and the flaw has not been identified, it is a very tedious \nand time-consuming process to find problems once the application is ready to move \ninto production. In addition, last minute fixing may affect the entire functionality of \nthe program and hamper deadlines set for product release. Also, it may create other \nsecurity flaws, which is possible with a large and complex code. \n\n2. Cost benefit\u2014cost is directly proportional to effort required. Not only development \ncost, but vulnerabilities identified in the production environment may involve more \ncosts. Again, it is well worth it as the costs associated with an attack can be much \nsteeper. \n\n3. Compliance\u2014some compliance makes it necessary to do a secure code review before \nlaunching the product. Therefore, an organization following complete SDLC has a  \nbetter chance of being certified. \n\n4. Reputation\u2014secure code review removes most of the security flaws in the earlier phase \nmaking it more secure than only black box assessments. Therefore, there is less chance \nof the product being compromised, which means less chance of reputation damage.\n\n\n\ncase study Step-By-Step Guide to Developing Healthcare Mobile Solutions 6\n\nData Privacy and Regulatory Compliance\n\nDuring architecture design and product implementation, it is vitally important to follow \nHIPAA Technical Safeguards guidelines.\n\nHIPAA Standards Sections Implementation\nAccess Control 164.312(a)(1) \u2022 Unique user identification\u2014UI shall provide \n\nauthentication mechanism with user name \nor e-mail and strong password (prohibits \nregistering with weak passwords, previous \npasswords, and easy guess keywords). \n\n\u2022 Role-based security\u2014user access level \nshould be \u201cminimum necessary\u201d and based \non privileges set by account administrator: \nview; view and modify; view, modify and \ncollaborate.\n\n\u2022 User credential encryption\u2014SSL 2048 \nshould be used to protect transferring user \ncredentials over network. The software \nshall not store user passwords, but only \nhash codes protected with algorithms \napproved by NIST (for example, SHA 256+).\n\n\u2022 Remember me\u2014to be turned off. \n\n\u2022 Auto-logoff\u2014although this implementation \nis optional in HIPAA, most healthcare \nsolutions implement it.\n\n\u2022 Emergency access procedure\u2014depends \non business requirements, should be \nconsidered during initial phase.\n\n\u2022 Access for non-registered users\u2014consider \nmasking patient code and limiting (again \n\u201cminimum necessary\u201d rule) patient personal \ninformation shared with such users.\n\n\n\ncase study Step-By-Step Guide to Developing Healthcare Mobile Solutions 7\n\nHIPAA Standards Sections Implementation\n\nAccess Control 164.312(a)(1) \u2022 Patient data encryption\u2014this \nimplementation is optional by HIPAA, but \nthe HITECH Act encourages encrypting \npatient data. Otherwise, if data is stolen, \nthe new requirements specify that \norganizations must contact every affected \nclient and report the breach to the \ngovernment. There are several approaches \nto meet this\u2014DB encryption, file-system \nencryption, disk or tape encryption, and \npatient de-identification. All PHI data stored \nlocally (local storage, cookies, and others) \nhas to be encrypted. Means allowing erase \ndata residing at the client side remotely \nshould be implemented whenever possible \n(for cases of device loss and similar). \n\n\u2022 Security testing\u2014SQL injection and other \ncommon attack types on data must be \nprevented at development time. Web \napplication has to be protected from \ncross-site request forgery (CSRF) attacks. \nThe applications need to go through \nthe security audits, vulnerability, and \npenetration testing before production. \n\n\u2022 Audit trail\u2014the software shall be able \nto track which person accessed which \nrecord (down to the patient level) on what \ndate, and whether it was viewed, shared, \nupdated, or deleted. Audit logs must either \nbe free from PHI or be secured\u2014encrypted \nor stored well protected.\n\n\n\ncase study Step-By-Step Guide to Developing Healthcare Mobile Solutions 8\n\nHIPAA Standards Sections Implementation\n\nAudit Controls 164.312(b) \u2022 Versioning\u2014modification changes on \npatient unstructured data such as radiology \nimages, DNA sequence files, etc. should be \nmade on a new copy of the data, preserving \nall previous data versions. The system shall \nnot delete PHI records physically from the \nstorage. \n\n\u2022 Patient data retention\u2014recommended \nretention period of radiological records is \nsix years after the conclusion of treatment. \n\n\u2022 The minimum retention period of \nmolecular pathology electronic reports, \nworksheets, and images is 20 years. \n\nIntegrity 164.312(c)(1) \u2022 Data authentication\u2014signature or check \nsum can be used to make sure that data is \nauthentic. Some storage solutions already \nimplement check sum integrity check. \n\n\u2022 Backups\u2014the data storage solution must \nsustain device failures and have the ability \nto quickly detect and repair any lost \nredundancy. This requirement is critical \nfor a data center or hosting provider. \nOLTP storage also must provide failover \ncapabilities with backup plans. All backups \nhave to be stored in an encrypted state.\n\nPerson or Entity \nAuthentication\n\n164.312(d) \u2022 Unique user identification\u2014see Access \nControl section. \n\n\u2022 Authentication with third party  \nsoftware\u2014recommend use of x.509 \ncertificates and tokens as secure \nmechanisms to authenticate t \nhe connected party. \n\n\n\ncase study Step-By-Step Guide to Developing Healthcare Mobile Solutions 9\n\nHIPAA Standards Sections Implementation\n\nTransmission Security 164.312(e)(1) \u2022 Integrity Controls\u2014usage of SSL/TLS \nprotocol over HTTP (i.e. HTTPS) or TCP will \nensure that data is not modified by \u201cman in \nthe middle.\u201d\n\n\u2022 Encryption\u2014all traffic to and from the \nhosted software should be protected by \nSSL 2048.

More precisely, do the artifacts that we\u2014as humans\u2014design \nhave intentionality behind them?\u00a0 \n\nFor years, philosophers have argued that the objects we create are inherently political. \nMeaning that when we design objects with a purpose in mind, that purpose carries a \nspecific intent, whether we realize it or not. Why is that, and what does it mean for the \nfuture of humanizing software? \n\nThe argument is fairly straightforward\u2014we are raised with conscious and unconscious \nbiases, aware or unaware of our own preferences and our own persuasions. \n\nAnd since we are raised with these biases, the output\u2014the \u201cstuff\u201d that we create\u2014\nautomatically inherits those biases. After all, the objects we create come from us. Our \ncreations are laden with politics, whether we realize it or not.\n\nFor example, a table is designed to be of a certain height. It is designed so that a person can \nsit comfortably at the table, perhaps to either eat or work. Sounds straightforward, right?\u00a0 \n\nConsider this: if the designer fails to incorporate the needs of someone who is in a \nwheelchair (i.e. the table is too tall) then the table does not satisfy that individual\u2019s need \nto eat or work at it, and therefore the table is useless. The politics of the table is clear: it \ncannot be universally adopted or used.\u00a0  \u00a0\n\nSo, if physical objects have politics, does that mean software does as well? What about \nthe user experience? How can we be certain that the experiences and interfaces of \ntomorrow will cater to a universal audience?\u00a0 \n\nToday, there are many cases where software has never been more human; increasingly, \nthe line between man and machine is indistinguishable. The machines and interfaces we \nmake take many forms; from smart phones to IoT devices, and are controlled by touch \nscreens, voice commands, gestures, fingerprints, and more. These machines cater to \nmost users\u2014and that isn\u2019t by accident.\u00a0 \n\nPeople are becoming more and more accustomed to the technology that is integrated \ninto their daily routines, whether it\u2019s using voice to check the weather, face recognition \nto unlock a phone, or even pay for services. And this integration becomes seamless with \nsoftware that understands how humans work.\n\n\n\nwhitepaper | What if Software was Human? 3\n\nIt\u2019s already happening. Google\u2019s AutoML system recently broke a record for categorizing \nimages by their content, scoring 82%. In iOS 11, Apple's Siri digital assistant uses layers \nof processing with a neural network that allows iPhones to mimic human speech. And a \nrecent survey from Dell revealed that 82% of respondents predicted humans and robots \nwill work together on teams within the next five years. \n\nBut machines don\u2019t become human-focused overnight. It takes time to infuse empathy \nand to create systems that serve users from all walks of life. We need to take care when \ndeveloping intelligent technology to ensure a human-centered approach.\n\nJust like us?\n\nIntelligent technology is driven by artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML), \nwhich are, in turn, driven by data. These three things drive the ability for humans to \nimprint ourselves on machines. \n\nAI is technology that allows machines to have the same characteristics of human \nintelligence\u2014our ability to sense, reason, and think. \n\nMachine learning is an application of AI based on the idea that we should give machines \naccess to data, parse it, learn from it, and then make a determination or prediction \nabout something in the world. So, rather than write task-oriented software routines with \na specific set of instructions, the machine is \u201ctrained\u201d using large amounts of data and \nalgorithms that give it the ability to learn how to perform the task.\n\nBut the real breakthrough is deep learning and neural networks. \n\nDeep learning is a technique for implementing ML that is able to \u201clearn\u201d patterns from \nlarge amounts of unstructured data. One popular algorithmic approach is neural \nnetworks, a structure that actually imitates the configuration of the human brain. As these \nneural networks process data, the connected web of parts adjusts itself, and enables the \nneural networks to interpret future data. \n\nhttps://www.wired.com/story/googles-learning-software-learns-to-write-learning-software/\nhttps://www.cnet.com/news/apple-ai-machine-learning-makes-siri-sound-human-on-ios-11/\nhttps://www.delltechnologies.com/en-us/perspectives/realizing-2030.htm#link=%7B%22role%22:%22standard%22,%22href%22:%22https://www.delltechnologies.com/en-us/perspectives/realizing-2030.htm%22,%22target%22:%22%22,%22absolute%22:%22%22,%22linkText%\nhttps://www.delltechnologies.com/en-us/perspectives/realizing-2030.htm#link=%7B%22role%22:%22standard%22,%22href%22:%22https://www.delltechnologies.com/en-us/perspectives/realizing-2030.htm%22,%22target%22:%22%22,%22absolute%22:%22%22,%22linkText%\n\n\nwhitepaper | What if Software was Human? 4\n\nBusinesses are becoming more and more creative with regard to how they interact \nwith their customers. So how will you use AI, ML, and experience design to drive your \ncompany into the future?\n\nBy allowing machines to learn about the nuances of human behavior, the machine itself \nis able to respond more effectively to the user. Humans are able to interact in a way that \nfeels natural while being \u201cunderstood\u201d by machines. \n\nBut the interface and overall solution suffer when a human-centered design approach is \nnot taken, ultimately hindering the effectiveness or adoption of the solution itself.  \n\nA truly empathetic approach to experience design will address:\n\n\u2022 The fundamentals of the user experience;\n\u2022 An empathetic, human-centered approach to understand the user;\n\u2022 Applying careful consideration and a deep understanding of who will use it and how;\n\u2022 The value that the product will deliver to the user; and\n\u2022 The relationship between the business and the customer.\n\nDriving business with AI\n\nImagine a sales associate using a smart device to see a customer\u2019s past purchases and \nconcluding which products to offer in-person. Or a healthcare professional receiving a \ndiagnosis and using it to influence a method of care. In these capacities, AI works to aid or \naugment what is ultimately a human decision, speeding the supply of information along.\n\nAI may also be used for intelligent automation, which accelerates decisions without human \nintervention. Imagine providing 24/7 support to customers, going beyond clunky replies to \nrather intelligent beings that can communicate effectively. Imagine using robots that can \nthink for themselves while they fulfill orders, zipping, traffic-free, through warehouses to \naid with shipping. Imagine autonomous cars that you can send to do your shopping, pick \nup a friend, or even use yourself for safer transportation.  \n\nA more human machine using\u2026\n\nVoice\n\nVoice has gone beyond being prompt-driven to comprehending entire exchanges, tones, \nand languages. And customers have taken notice, to the point where voice interfaces \nare regularly used by those who want to be hands-free. According to Gartner, by 2021, \nearly adopter brands that redesign their websites to support visual and voice search will \nincrease digital commerce revenue by 30%.\n\nhttps://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/gartner-top-strategic-predictions-for-2018-and-beyond/\n\n\nwhitepaper | What if Software was Human? 5\n\nVoice commands can be used in any variety of products, from car dashboards to \nheadphones, going beyond Amazon\u2019s Alexa or Apple\u2019s Siri. And voice control is under the \nspotlight as one of the best innovations in the immediate future. Voice interfaces are also \nbeing integrated into the healthcare industry as a way for providers to speak directly to log \nelectronic health records (EHRs), for patients to monitor illness, and as an empowerment \ntool for those who want to live more independently. Voice interfaces can even serve as \npseudo therapists, as in the way of Replika, an AI \u201cfriend\u201d that listens to you.\n\nIoT\n\nAs pervasive as voice interfaces are, IoT devices also make up a large part of the \napplication for human-driven software. \n\nIn many ways, IoT mimics many of the functions of the human body. The cloud being the \n\u201cbrain\u201d and the device being the \u201cbody.\u201d IoT is all about the connectivity of sensors and \nfield devices, connecting physical and digital worlds. \n\nConnected home, personal wearables, and smart cities are only a few of the applications for \nIoT, but they create a foundation for innumerable other products. In fact, Gartner predicts \nthat by 2020, IoT technology will be in 95% of electronics for new product designs. \n\nConnecting devices means more data, which in turn creates more humanistic, personalized \nexperiences for the user. Today, IoT devices can do anything: restock groceries via smart \nrefrigerator, monitor insulin intake via wearable, lock your front door via app, etc. \n\nOther applications\n\nThere\u2019s still a lot of exploration to be done in other interfaces for humanistic software. In \nthe realms of augmented and virtual reality (AR and VR, respectively), most are limited to \nconsidering gaming and entertainment values. However, there is a strong argument to be \nmade for using AR and VR for training programs in intensive professions, like piloting or \nmanaging heavy machinery. There are also possibilities in the world of healthcare, as AR \nand VR are being explored as an avenue for learning to perform surgery.\n\nConclusion\n\nBusinesses need to rise to the occasion of what customers expect, and human-driven \nsoftware and interactions is the new normal. But these systems are incredibly complex, \nand do not always serve each and every user. That\u2019s why a truly human-centered \napproach, that mirrors as many of our behaviors as possible, is needed. In an age when \nvirtually any company can develop a solution, creators need to address these imperatives.\n\nIn the future, machine learning and artificial intelligence might develop software on \nour behalf. We\u2019ll leave it up to the next generation of philosophers to determine if that \nsoftware is human, or not. \n\nhttps://replika.ai/\nhttps://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/gartner-top-strategic-predictions-for-2018-and-beyond/\n\n\nwhitepaper | What if Software was Human? 6\n\nFor now, we as humans continue to blend man and machine, and it is absolutely critical to \nconsider human-centered design from concept to production. \n\nImagine the opportunities that AI and ML will present for your business and ultimately \nfor your customers. But also consider the negative impact of designing without such an \napproach\u2014your software solution or interface could be laden with politics whether you \nrealize it or not. \n\nThe future is now\u2014is your business ready?

Tustan used \nto be a fortification and administrative center, as well as customs point on \nwhat was called the \u2018salt route\u2019.\n\nSoftServe\u2019s R&D division was consulted to develop a mobile augmented \nreality (AR) application, which, with the help of added reality technology, \nwould show the medieval Tustan fortress of the IX-XVI centuries.\n\nThe idea to reconstruct the castle was the dream of Ukrainian scientist and \nethnographer, Mykhaylo Rozhko. Today his son Vasyl Rozhko is supporting \nthe effort. Reconstruction started from manual measurements of about \n4000 locations where wooden planks were placed on the stones between \n1971 and 1977. The first graphic reconstruction was made with pencil and \npaper based on known architecture samples of the time and some wooden \nremains, with up to 90% accuracy.\n\n \n\n\n\ncase study | SoftServe\u2019s Augmented Reality App Reconstructs a Disappeared Wooden Medieval Ukrainian Castle 2\n\nProject Description\n\nTo begin developing this app, SoftServe needed to address several challenges, as all that \nremains of the fortress today are the sites where wooden blocks were situated. It\u2019s an area \nthat is not similar to other traditional historical sites. In addition, the rocks of the castle had \ncrumbled over time which changed the original outline. SoftServe had to make sure the \nrocks on matched those in reality and the ones in the developed 3D model.\n\n\u201cBuilding the Tustan AR app was a unique challenge with new levels of complexity\u201d, said \nSemen Frish, VR Engineer at SoftServe. \u201cWorking closely with Vasyl Rozhko, the founder of \nthe reservation and \u2018Tu Stan!\u2019 festival, and the initiator of the project, we share his passion \nto help bring this historic castle back to life. The solution we developed can be applied to \nthe virtual reconstruction of other historical sites in Ukraine and all over the World. We are \nready to share our best practices for the preservation of historical heritage\u201d.\n\nTwo specialists from SoftServe\u2019s R&D team worked on the project over the course of a \nyear. The reconstruction started with physical measurement of the location, examining the \nexisting materials and plans. The use of drones aided in reaching the less accessible areas.  \nPhotogrammetry reconstruction allowed the team to create digital graphic models of the \nrocks to within with millimeters of accuracy.\n\nThe task was to ensure that the rocks depicted in \nthe photographs (with blue outline) coincided with \nthe rocks in the real environment and the rocks on \nthe developed 3D model (with orange contour). The \n3D model had to match the actual landscape, taking \ninto account the depth and clipping.\n\nThe camera and model had numerous parameters, such as focal length and physical size of \nthe sensor, distortion of the lens, zoom and rotation. To pick up these parameters quickly and \naccurately, SoftServe used several algorithms for mathematical modeling of reconstruction.\n\n\u2022 The BLAM plugin for Blender was used to determine the parameters of the camera. \nIt worked flawlessly, but did not solve the problem, because there were no long \nstraight lines on the territory of the fortress and around it. In order to avoid finding the \nactual location of dots for visual markers in manual mode, the team further analyzed \ntechnologies such as OpenCV for reconstructing camera parameters, a software \npackage for laser scanning, LAStools, and photogrammetry techniques and MeshLab.\n\n\u2022 SFM (structure from motion) and MVS (multi view stereo) algorithms were used based \non the Photo Tourism project that Google Street View is based on to get a digital model \nthat shows camera settings, photo positioning in space and 3D transformation models.\n\n\n\ncase study | SoftServe\u2019s Augmented Reality App Reconstructs a Disappeared Wooden Medieval Ukrainian Castle 3\n\nDuring the initial experiments, the idea was to abandon the rigid printed markers. With \nGoogle Tango, it was possible to build functionality to locate a castle in complemented \nreality in accordance with any flat surface in the room for those with a Tango-compatible \nphone or tablet. Today, Tango-compatible devices are not very common, but SoftServe is \nworking to offer more interactive features for the Tustan AR application with the newer AR \ntechnology from Google ARCore in the near future.\n\nResults\n\nThe Tustan AR mobile app is live in real time on location and is available in any weather \nconditions. Castle can be viewed remotely by downloading a free app in the App Store or \nthe Play Market. Images to experience augmented reality are included on the apps pages. \nCode and models can be found in open access and anyone is welcome to make their \nown reconstructions for the outdoor landmarks on top of it.

There\u2019s no doubt it\u2019s a hot topic, and \nrightly so. AI has enormous potential to reshape business. When properly leveraged, AI \nsolutions drive efficiency, optimize processes, and enhance experiences. In a global study \npublished by the Boston Consulting Group and MIT Sloan Management Review, 84% of the \n3,000 business leaders interviewed expect AI to give them a competitive advantage.\n\nDespite the interest, AI is underutilized in many of today\u2019s industries. Only 23% of the \nleaders surveyed have already incorporated AI into their business models. This could put \nbusinesses that aren\u2019t utilizing AI at a huge disadvantage compared to companies that \nhave already adopted the technology and excel at its integration.\n\nArtificial intelligence is not a replacement for human intelligence. On the contrary, AI \nperpetually learns and delivers human interactions, while saving us time by eliminating the \nwasted motion and human error associated with redundant tasks.\n\nBlinded by buzzwords\n\nIs AI or intelligent automation (IA) better? How does AI and IA work? These are a few of the \nquestions to ask when deciding how AI can best be leveraged.\n\nAI is essentially made up of computer systems that \u201clearn\u201d from patterns sensed and \nsynthesized from vast amounts of big data to perform tasks that normally require human \nintelligence. Such tasks include visual perception, speech recognition, decision-making, \nand translation between languages. Voice-powered personal assistants like Siri and Alexa, \nAmazon recommendations, and Google Translate are common examples of AI.\n\nIntelligent automation (IA) is a mix of augmented and amplified intelligence\u2014loosely defined \nas the combination of artificial intelligence with automation\u2014and includes natural language \nprocessing, machine learning, and machine vision. IA is an application of AI that automates \nentire processes or workflows, learning and adapting as they go. Examples include making \ndecisions about textual information to guide autonomous vehicles and advanced robots. \n\nhttps://sloanreview.mit.edu/projects/reshaping-business-with-artificial-intelligence/\n\n\nwhitepaper | Artificial Intelligence: Revolutionize Business Today 3\n\nAI isn\u2019t a universal technology, but is rather composed of building blocks that\u2014\nindividually or in concert\u2014adds intelligence to applications. Its intricacies depend on \nwhat information is sought, and whether that information can be gleaned from the \ndata. And since data is gathered across departments and companies at a variety of \ndifferent touchpoints, increasing the amount of data that fuels AI systems makes them \nexponentially smarter and more effective.\n\nThe proper toolkit\n\nTo leverage AI, matching requirements with the right technology to ensure the right \napplication is vital. Proper AI matching depends on two important factors\u2014big data and \ndomain knowledge. Without these components, AI simply cannot work.\n\nBig data is necessary to glean patterns for effective AI\u2014but not just any big data will do. \nThe intricacy of the problem depends on specific data location, flow of data, quality of \ndata, and system integration. Often, despite a promising use case and a large amount of \ndata, AI cannot be implemented due to signals and patterns that ultimately don\u2019t align.\n\nPlatforms\u2014such as Google Cloud and Amazon Web Service\u2014lower the barrier of entry \nand make AI readily available. They include frameworks for developing, testing, and \ntraining machine learning models as well as leveraging pre-built models as appropriate. \nDespite the user-friendly nature of these platforms, subject matter and AI domain \nexpertise are necessary for complex problem solving.\n\nSpeaking of automation\n\nForrester reports that \u201c\u2026the future of robotic process automation (RPA) lies with \ncognitive-AI enhancement\u2014due to its ability to solve more business problems in a more \nsophisticated fashion.\u201d Advances in machine learning techniques, improvements in \nsensors, and an increase in computing power have helped create a new generation of \nhardware and software robots with practical applications in nearly every industry sector. \n\nWhy? Because automation does not require complex thought processes, and it minimizes \nhuman error that comes with performing repetitive tasks. \n\nhttps://go.forrester.com/blogs/automation-ai-and-robotics-are-critical-cio-targets/\n\n\nwhitepaper | Artificial Intelligence: Revolutionize Business Today 4\n\nSome assembly required\n\nDon\u2019t believe what the movies portray. Despite AI\u2019s ability to \u201clearn\u201d and distinguish \npatterns, artificial intelligence is not alive. It is an impersonal, back-end process that is \ncapable of producing unpredictable outcomes. \n\nNor is AI the solution to every challenge. Ignoring this fact can be costly on many levels.\n\nAt SoftServe, our teams work with clients to identify where AI is the right fit, and assess \nwhat it will take to implement compared to the projected value it will deliver.\n\nThere are four kinds of AI project classifications\n\n\u2022 Simple solutions\u2014Easy implementation for some added value\n\u2022 Quick wins\u2014Easy implementation that brings significant value\n\u2022 Must-haves\u2014Hard to create and execute but brings significant value\n\u2022 Impossibilities\u2014Hard to implement and does not bring value\n\nBefore assuming that AI is the answer, assess the nature of the problem itself: Is AI the \nbest solution? Is the problem solvable with AI? Is there an easier way to solve the problem \nwithout implementing AI?\n\nConclusion\n\nAI is a cutting-edge technology that increases efficiency and speed\u2014ultimately making our \nlives easier. Instead of spending significant time and energy on tedious or repetitive tasks, \nAI speeds the process, saving valuable time. But AI needs a proper assessment before \nimplementation to ensure that it is the best option for a business challenge.\n\nTo learn how to use tomorrow\u2019s technology today, contact SoftServe.\n\n\u2022 1.\n\u2022 2.\n\u2022 3.\n\u2022 4.\n\n\n\nABOUT US\nSoftServe is a global digital authority and consulting company, operating \nat the cutting edge of technology.

If companies don't act quickly to create and maintain value for \ncustomers across all touchpoints, a decline in market share is inevitable. As the pace of \ntechnology continues to accelerate, companies that fail to innovate will fall behind.\n\nSo how will companies of the future maintain relevance? How will they keep the customer\u2019s \nperspective central to their operations, ensuring value is always being created?\n\nAt SoftServe, we believe value stream thinking (VST)\u2014a classic concept, but more \nrelevant now than ever\u2014is essential to remain competitive in the digital economy.\n\nWhat is a value stream?\n\nPut simply, whenever a market demand exists, there is potential to create value. \n\nA value stream is comprised of the activities required to meet demand, or more \nspecifically, what it takes to create and deliver a valuable product or service to the \ncustomer. The concept reads simple enough, yet companies in today's complex \nlandscape continue to suffer from silos and hierarchies, primarily at a technology level, \nbut also at organizational levels. \n\nIn a world of fragmented attention spans, coupled with fierce competition for positive \nengagement and memorable experiences, many companies lose sight of their ultimate \ngoal: to provide value for the customer, on her terms.\n\n\n\nwhitepaper | Value Stream Thinking: DevOps and Beyond 3\n\nValue stream thinking in action\n\nWhat does it look like when VST is applied to software development?\n\nThe best examples are those that improve efficiency and eliminate waste, resulting in \nbetter communication and superior value propositions. Establishing a chain process in \nwhich value is added at each step is paramount\u2014while conversely, an inferior approach \ncan cause value to be lost rapidly. In software engineering, DevOps is a prime example \nof effectively applied value stream thinking.\n\nThe DevOps movement drives agile collaboration between two pillars of the software \ncreation process\u2014development and operations\u2014making their interaction seamless. DevOps \nprovides a combination of tools and practices that facilitate successful communication \nbetween these often-disparate teams, accelerating solution delivery, minimizing downtime, \nincreasing time to innovate, while minimizing complexity and reducing costs. \n\nDevOps also supports implementing changes incrementally throughout the entire \ndevelopment and testing process. The ability to retrieve feedback from the end-user \nand include requested changes in a timely fashion creates added value. Time is the most \nvaluable resource in the ever-accelerating software industry, and a difference of one week \nin delivery can be the difference between being an innovation leader or a laggard.\n\nLet\u2019s take a closer look at two case studies where value stream \nthinking was put into practice within healthcare and financial \nservices.\n\nValue stream thinking is useful in foreseeing the challenges faced by participants in \ntoday\u2019s healthcare ecosystems. From the inability to successfully share each other\u2019s data \nto processing delays, the healthcare industry is replete with easily identifiable instances \nof value opportunities missed, lost, or destroyed\u2014all contributing to rising costs. When \npatient data from exams, imaging, and wearable devices like pace trackers, blood pressure \nmeters, and smart scales are shared throughout the healthcare ecosystem, all members \nbenefit through the collaborative interconnectedness. \n\nValue stream thinking can be leveraged to improve outcome reporting as well. For example, \nOutcomes Based Healthcare (OBH) partnered with SoftServe to create a mobile solution \nthat dramatically improves patient reported outcomes (PRO) via continuous and passive \nsmart phone monitoring. The project was broken down into multiple phases including \ninvestigation, application architecture, development & user interface (UI), integration, and \ntesting. The app itself was built using an iterative \u2018agile scrum\u2019 methodology.\n\nhttps://outcomesbasedhealthcare.com/product/\n\n\nwhitepaper | Value Stream Thinking: DevOps and Beyond 4\n\nYet another example of value stream thinking in practice is within the financial services \nindustry and development of blockchain solutions. What if the objective was to build the \nworld\u2019s first invoice exchange platform to serve private investors, banks, and alternative \nfinancial bodies\u2014while speeding the turnover of capital by enabling the selling of assets \nbefore their maturity date? We delivered exactly that for our client by optimizing the use \nof distributed ledger technology (DLT) to augment invoice trading, while empowering \nanyone with the opportunity to easily trade invoices or other assets\u2014securely, \ntransparently, and simply.\n\nValue stream thinking as prevention\n\nImagine a retailer successfully grows its online presence. The company has thousands of \nloyal customers who enjoy the ease of making online purchases, frequent promotions, \nswift home delivery, high quality customer service, convenient product review \nsubmissions, and useful financing options.\n\nSuddenly, a cyberattack compromises customers\u2019 online payment data and disrupts \nthe company\u2019s entire value stream. The company\u2019s hard-earned reputation is damaged, \ncustomers are frustrated, and financial losses are inevitable. \n\nObviously, the hackers are to blame, but the real culprits are buried in the retailer\u2019s \nlegacy IT systems, which impeded the implementation of stronger security features. \nHad the retailer analyzed its supply chain from a value stream perspective, it may have \ndiscovered\u2014long before the attack occurred\u2014that vulnerabilities in the value stream were \naccidents waiting to happen.\n\n\n\nwhitepaper | Value Stream Thinking: DevOps and Beyond 5\n\nPrinciples of value stream thinking\n\nEvery industry has its own version of an ideal value stream. However, regardless of \nindustry, the core principles of applying value streams remain the same\u2014efficiency, the \nelimination of repetitive steps, simplification, interoperability between different parts in \nthe value creation chain, and adaptability to changes in the value stream. \n\nSuccessfully applying value stream thinking to an existing process includes mapping \neach step to visualize the connections between moving parts and to scrutinize how \nthey interact. This requires an openness across groups, and an open dialogue between \nthem, are essential to ultimately producing value for the customer through improved \nexperiences, and the removal of bottlenecks and friction.\n\nOf course, in an ideal world, value stream thinking and detailed technology discussions are \npresent from the beginning of the business or solution design process. After all, proactive \nthinking always wins against a reactive approach.\n\nThe effort to maximize value additions and minimize value losses creates a disciplined \nway of analyzing and improving complex processes, regardless of industry or sector. \nThese optimizations promote the universal objective of delivering the best possible value \nproposition to an end-user\u2014which is crucial in the new, just-in-time, digital economy.\n\n\n\nwhitepaper | Value Stream Thinking: DevOps and Beyond 6\n\nTechnology is the cornerstone\n\nEfficiency, the elimination of repetitive steps, simplification, interoperability, and \nadaptability to change must be present in order to achieve maximum value creation. \n\nCritical questions in value stream thinking include:\n\n\u2022 What can be done to optimize a process?\n\u2022 What can be added or eliminated to ensure that value is obvious and accessible to the\n\nend-user?\n\u2022 Does technology need to be changed?\n\u2022 Should personnel training be increased?\n\u2022 Can new value be unlocked by looking at data from a different angle?\n\nAt the business architecture level, technology needs to be imagined, shaped, and applied \nto protect and bring together value stream components. \n\nCompanies that learn to adapt and continually evolve to meet the changing demands of \nthe market will continue to thrive.

As technology \nadvances, companies are challenged to innovate, meeting the latest needs and \nexpectations of the customer\u2014and fast. \n\nAn organization\u2019s success depends on its ability to innovate. Businesses need to innovate \nto change, to stay relevant and ahead of competition. Companies like Apple, Facebook, \nTwitter, Uber, and Airbnb are built on innovative ideas and continue to explore new ways \nand means to disrupt the market.  \n\nSo, what is holding your business back?  \n\nMany companies are hesitant to innovate for various reasons, which most commonly \ninclude:\n\n\u2022 High probability of failure\n\u2022 Asking for ideation without a mechanism in place\n\u2022 Pushing for answers without defining problems\n\u2022 Urging risk-taking while punishing commercial failure\n\u2022 Defining an innovative approach without the internal ability to execute\n\nInnovation, by nature, is difficult to sustain\u2014but it\u2019s not impossible.\n\nIn Steve Johnson\u2019s TED talk, he describes the human tendency to think of ideas as \nisolated things, when really \u201can idea is a network on the most elemental level. Ideas are \ncobbled together from whatever is lying around.\u201d We form them by taking things we\u2019ve \nlearned or heard or read about and bringing them together in new ways. We form new \nideas by making connections, and therefore the best environments for cultivating ideas are \nones that feature diverse perspectives and opinions.\n\nSo how will you innovate your business to fit the market and the customer needs? And \nhow will you do it quickly?\n\nWhat if you could avoid common mistakes, \nand deliver innovation today?\n\nhttps://www.ted.com/talks/steven_johnson_where_good_ideas_come_from\n\n\nwhitepaper | What if Innovation Creates a Better Future\u2014Now? 3\n\nNot All Innovation Has to be Radical\n\nInnovation has a reputation for transforming markets and creating groundbreaking \nsolutions to customer problems and needs. In theory, the ideal innovative solution is \ncompletely revolutionary, but in practice, innovation can take many forms. In fact, there \nare four generally accepted kinds of innovation:\n\n\u2022 Incremental \u2013 Using existing technology to increase the value to the customer           \n(i.e. features, design changes, etc.) within the existing market. \n\n\u2022 Disruptive \u2013 Applying new technology and/or processes to your business and its \nexisting market.\n\n\u2022 Architectural \u2013 Applying learned lessons, skills, and processes to a different market.\n\u2022 Radical \u2013 This is the most commonly cited kind of innovation\u2014innovation that creates \n\na new industry via revolutionary technology (think Uber or Netflix).\n\nNot all innovation has to be radical. You don\u2019t need to create a new market to make a \nsplash among your existing customers. \n\nDepending on your company structure, your clientele, and/or your budget, you may \ndiscover that incremental, disruptive, or architectural innovation is the answer to keeping \nyour customers happy. Regardless of the kind of innovation that you find is right for you, \nit should be implemented with certain goals in mind, and within a certain structure to \nguarantee that all of those goals are met.\n\nMake Something Out of Nothing\n\nIn his essay \u201cThe End of Creativity,\u201d Kevin Ashton debunks myths about creativity, \nnamely that it\u2019s the work of geniuses having flashes of insight. He argues that innovation is \nrarely the work of one individual in an \u201caha\u201d moment. Instead, it\u2019s a step-by-step journey, \noften a collaborative one, which leads to innovation through each person building on the \nwork of each other. \n\nInnovation relies on employees having time and energy to ideate, a company that \nsupports a fail-fast mindset, and incorporating outside-in collaboration for valuable \ninsights. By having a structure for this process, many people approaching the same \nchallenge simultaneously, working together and building on each other\u2019s insights to come \nup with a solution.\n\nMany businesses fail to realize this, and approach innovation without structure to manage \nideas or outside collaboration. By asking for a solution to a problem that hasn\u2019t been \nidentified, or demanding results without providing the proper resources, many businesses \nend up investing in innovation that doesn\u2019t create substantial ROI.\n\nhttp://www.howtoflyahorse.com/the-end-of-creativity/\n\n\nwhitepaper | What if Innovation Creates a Better Future\u2014Now? 4\n\nInnovate Quickly and Effectively\n\nInnovation initiatives frequently fail due to lack of structure and expertise. But by tracking \nprogress, digital innovation gets done quickly and efficiently.\n\nThe secret to fast and efficient innovation is leveraging services and expertise from \nadvisors who can guide the process and teach sustaining innovation techniques.  And \nincluding everyone who has a relevant perspective \u2013 both inside your company and outside.  \nAccording to Gartner, the #1 most effective, least used digital innovation \u201chack\u201d is \ncrowdsourcing. By creating an environment ripe for innovation, your business receives \nmore input from an array of different perspectives that can offer value to fuel your journey.\n\nStructure for Tracking Success\n\nWhat are your objectives for innovation? Who is your audience? What are you hoping to \naccomplish? How will you track your ideas and progress?\n\nOften, the innovation process is difficult to monitor. Defining these problems isn\u2019t easy. \nCompanies are often stymied by a limited point of view, or by being over-reliant on internal \nemployees that think within the company\u2019s existing mentality. \n\nWith SoftServe\u2019s Innovation Platform, our software-driven process uncovers your \nbusiness\u2019s challenges and goals. \n\nSuccessful\nInnovation\n\nStructure\n\nThe mechanism \nfor crowdsourcing; \ntracking ideas, \ngoals, progress, \nand solutions\n\nExpertise\n\nDiverse knowledge \nand experience \nthat fuels fast, \neffective results\n\nhttps://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/five-digital-innovation-hacks/\nhttps://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/five-digital-innovation-hacks/\n\n\nwhitepaper | What if Innovation Creates a Better Future\u2014Now? 5\n\nBy providing you with a multitude of perspectives, structure, and tools, you identify viable \noptions quickly, retaining the history of what was discussed.

The enterprise routinely collects \nand acquires necessary data sets, and the analytics team is providing well-crafted \nsummaries companywide.\n\nSo far, so good. But now what?\n\nMany enterprises conceptually understand the value of data, yet most lack formal \ndata valuation policies. Less than half of structured data is actively used in decision-\nmaking. Meanwhile, discovery and preparation consume the majority of the typical data \nanalyst\u2019s time.\n\nThe value of data rests upon its uniqueness, how it is being used, and by whom. There are \nmany opportunities for value extraction from the time the raw data is collected to when \ndata-driven insights are applied\u2014and beyond. \n\nAs a result, any company seeking to improve value must define a clear data value strategy \ndriven by the following questions:\n\n\u2022 How can we leverage our data for maximum business advantage? \n\u2022 Should we use data to raise internal efficiencies, to build competitive advantage, or \n\nboth?\n\nWhile \u201cboth\u201d may seem like the obvious answer, accelerating the journey from status \nquo to new value capture demands vision, discipline, and experience. Without an explicit \ndata value strategy, the latent value buried within the troves of data upon which most \ncompanies now run may remain just that\u2014latent, and ultimately wasted.\n\nGo big with data value (or go home)\n\nMcKinsey reports companies that leverage customer behavior insights outperform peers \nby 85 percent in sales growth. There are two common ways that brands can improve \nbottom-line results by accelerating data value creation:\n\n\u2022 Companies should initiate a discovery and evaluation process to determine what, if any \ndata is already being leveraged properly. Disparate silos and failure to collaborate with \ncommon data will leech productivity, efficiency, and profitability.\n\n\u2022 Investing in the capabilities of internal teams and tools to leverage data assets is also \nkey. No matter how well-tuned data may be, without the proper AI-driven tools (backed \nby a team of data management and analyst experts), top speed potential will never be \nrealized.\n\nAdvanced insights into transactional data can improve consumer identification and deepen \nunderstanding of the underlying behavioral patterns driving purchase decisions. Data \nanalysis will optimize products, services, and processes by enhancing managerial decision-\nmaking. Cloud-driven agility enables companies to do more with the data already gathered \nmuch more quickly and efficiently.\n\nhttps://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/whats-your-data-worth/\nhttps://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/whats-your-data-worth/\nhttps://hbr.org/2017/05/whats-your-data-strategy\nhttps://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/mckinsey-analytics/our-insights/capturing-value-from-your-customer-data\n\n\nwhitepaper | Why You Need a Data Value Strategy 3\n\nNew technological tools signal the next frontier of data value creation. Applications that \nprovide data insights (delivered in intelligible formats) make it easier for less technically \ninclined leadership to make intuitive choices and derive more business benefits. \nPerformance management software enables managers to routinely make data-based \ndecisions. Embedded data visualization software can add value through pattern recognition, \nwhile artificial intelligence (AI) drives machine learning, language, and AR/VR innovation.\n\nBut the benefits of a data value strategy extend beyond current corporate operations. \nThere is often untapped revenue to be captured by applying the analytics that generate \nquality internal insights in ways that external users will find valuable. (For some \ncompanies, it may make sense to focus on complementary data chains so that those may \nlikewise be monetized.)\n\nNavigating new revenue streams\n\nA study of organizations and companies found that while the volume of their stored \ndata was growing on average by 40 percent annually, few had policies in place to \ndetermine the value of this stored data for other potential users. The monetization of \ndata through its sale for use by third parties is a potentially lucrative revenue source.\n\nThe data value chain has multiple points at which value can be extracted, but in order to \nfurther tap this potential resource, an enterprise needs an external value strategy, that is, a \nfull understanding of how to commercialize data (by the regulatory book), including: which \ndata has the greatest value and which formats will prove most useful for external users. \n\nWith that in mind, one of the first steps a company must take is to assess the market \nand determine whether greater benefits will be derived from pursuing enterprise or \nsmaller opportunities. \n\nSetting a strategy must also account for data sets at different stages (raw, processed, or \nin the analysis-and-insights phase), and strategic planners will have to assess how this \nmay impact other stages of data collection and/or analysis. \n\nWith data monetization being a largely unexplored territory for many companies, in-\nhouse valuation expertise may be lacking. Brands need to either create or bolster \ninternal teams and processes that are agile enough to undertake the assessments \nand tasks associated with data value creation. With sufficient internal capabilities, \ncompanies may also consider the benefits of cross-industry alliances\u2014particularly in an \nage where consumers value seamless transactions and integrations.\n\nDISCOVER INGEST PROCESS PERSIST INTEGRATE ANALYZE EXPOSE\n\nhttps://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/whats-your-data-worth/\n\n\nwhitepaper | Why You Need a Data Value Strategy 4\n\nA word of caution\n\nOne cannot seriously consider data monetization without also recognizing the potential \nrisks related to all handling of data. As security concerns continue to increase, companies \nformulating their strategy must make data security integral or face the possibility that \nany value created may be undermined. Concerns may range from an actual breach to a \ncareless employee\u2019s loss of data, along with the almost certain negative publicity.\n\nRegulatory frameworks governing transparency, purpose, consent, and data minimization \nare still evolving across the world. Yet there is general awareness that any data \nmonetization business involves customer privacy issues. Adhering to and demonstrating \nrigorous compliance with security and data protection standards has advanced from being \na nice benefit to becoming prerequisite. However, fear of consumer concerns need not \ninhibit evaluation of the overall market opportunity. \n\nWhat companies need to provide is assurance that consumers are respected; that \nconsumer data is protected, and that consumer data has value. One excellent technique \nis to ensure a valid exchange of value to the end consumer for the usage of their data\u2014a \ncompetitive differentiator from the basic service. Companies may offer a range of insights-\ndriven incentives that customers will gladly exchange personal data for, but this fair \nexchange of value requires testing and creativity. \n\nWhile more could be written on strategy, theory, and best practices\u2014the most effective way to \ndemonstrate the benefits of data value strategy is to share SoftServe\u2019s experience with our clients.\n\nA TALE OF TWO CLIENTS \n\nA company may recognize the value of data and understand that there are insights to be \ngained. Less clear may be which insights are needed, where they can be derived from, and \nwhere learnings can be applied.\n\nClient 1: digital differentiation\n\nDespite vast expertise within its field, one SoftServe client needed assistance in building a \ndifferentiating advantage against competitors with greater digital resources. Focusing on both \ninternal and external strategies, SoftServe helped to digitally transform its global consulting \noperations end-to-end. \n\nThe challenge was two-fold: build digital transformation services for the client\u2019s clients and \ncreate an innovative and transformative internal data value strategy. To help accelerate and \noptimize a truly integrated global platform, SoftServe created several solutions to augment the \nproprietary product, including: \n\n\n\nwhitepaper | Why You Need a Data Value Strategy 5\n\n\u2022 Delivery of an assortment advisor to define optimal price and supply for products \nbased on collected performance data\n\n\u2022 Design and development of an advisor to evaluate the effectiveness of promotional \ncampaigns and marketing budgets\n\n\u2022 Development of a solution to produce predictive and prescriptive analytics using a data \nscience platform \n\n\u2022 Development of a dynamic pricing solution that provides yet another source of data \nanalysis in our client\u2019s portfolio.\n\nClient 2: better sales\n\nA leader in price optimization and pricing management applications, this client sought to \nenhance insights for sales initiatives with the hopes of transforming the rate of contract \nrenewal and prospect retention. To better support these objectives, the company sought \nto provide optimized sales and price recommendations without risking its bottom line. \n\nBuilding upon the client\u2019s existing product while developing a new version, SoftServe \ndeveloped a set of pre-packaged analytic user components:\n\n\u2022 Master data format\n\u2022 Data profiling tool\n\u2022 Automated SSIS packaging\n\u2022 Data quality validation\n\nThese components, combined with several key technologies\u2014predictive analytics, \nsoftware integration, and custom predictive engines\u2014resulted in on-demand, high-\nvalue analytic capabilities. SoftServe\u2019s work enabled prices getting to market significantly \nfaster, cross-browser compatibility of the redesigned interface, improved visual analytics \nwith greater analytical depth, and generally better pricing due to improved precision, \nmarket alignment, and greater transparency. With a clear value strategy in mind, \nSoftServe delivered insights that enabled our client to not only gain value through internal \nperformance optimization but enhanced their positioning with their own clients.\n\nIn closing\n\nAt Softserve, we understand that the value of data depends on both the current and \ndesired (future) state of affairs, and no data value journey will ever be precisely the same. \n\nFrom data pipeline automation to SaaS/RaaS solutions, creating enhanced visualization \ntools, or building a platform to accelerate user insights\u2014our team understands the full \npotential of data.

Environmental hazards (physical or chemical) and health issues (loss of \nattention under stress or heart attacks) remain some of the highest risks. For better \nprotection, workers must constantly wear personal protective equipment (PPE). However, \nworkers tend to eschew these protocols for various reasons:\n\n\u2022 Lack of risk awareness. Workers have no real-time information about a hazardous \nenvironment. This decreases workers\u2019 motivation to follow safety rules. It is especially \nimportant for health problems, where unsafe behavior leads to occupational diseases \nover the course of months or years.\n\n\u2022 Overconfidence. Experienced workers often overestimate their own ability to assess \nconditions and, therefore, do not use PPE.\n\n\u2022 Macho culture. A workplace culture based on assertiveness, competitiveness, and \nboldness decreases workers\u2019 attitudes toward safety issues. It has emerged in a so-\ncalled \u201cTexas period\u201d , where minor accidents and procedure defiance were almost a \nbadge of honor. \n\nAs reported recently by the US Department of Labor, the top most frequently cited OSHA \nstandards violated in 2018 include:\n\n\u2022 Fall protection\n\u2022 Hazard communication\n\u2022 General scaffolding requirements\n\u2022 Respiratory protection\n\u2022 Control of hazardous energy, lockout/tagout\n\u2022 Ladders\n\u2022 Powered industrial trucks\n\u2022 Fall protection, training requirements\n\u2022 General machine guarding requirements\n\u2022 Eye and face personal protective and lifesaving equipment\n \nTraining and diligence are very helpful for to reducing workplace accidents and injuries, but \nwhen it comes to bringing workers home safe, it is not enough. Embedded technologies \nintegrated into smart workwear or as standalone devices enable the continuous \nmonitoring of dangerous conditions.\n\nSmart workwear\n\nBased on IoT edge trends and current market analysis, research suggests workwear with \nan integrated wearable device allows workers to:\n\n\u2022 Continuously monitor environmental conditions, alarming workers and their neighbors \nabout risky and critical situations, without interrupting for measurement or for using \nadditional standalone or mobile tools.\n\n\u2022 Continuously monitor vital signs and behavior, alerting the closest coworker that help \nis needed. This monitoring enables small teams and self-employed workers to continue \nworking without having to constantly be in one another\u2019s line of vision.\n\nhttps://www.msdsonline.com/2018/10/23/oshas-top-10-most-cited-violations-of-2018/\nhttps://www.msdsonline.com/2018/10/23/oshas-top-10-most-cited-violations-of-2018/\n\n\nwhitepaper | Smart Workwear for Safer Work 3\n\nInvestigating solutions, SoftServe\u2019s R&D team built several smart workwear prototypes, \nfocusing on smart workwear jackets. The team built each smart workwear jacket prototype \nwith an embedded device and sensors, researched algorithms for detecting workers\u2019 \ninstant health issues and unsafe behavior (\u201cman down\u201d accident, heart attack), and \nimplemented algorithms in firmware and android software. Results had in-field tests and \nmeasurements to verify performance parameters (distance, power consumption, working \ntime, detection of accidents).\n\nThe next sections will provide a more detailed description of the system architecture and \nthe results achieved.\n\nIMPLEMENTING A SMART WORKWEAR SYSTEM \nConstruction workers are the target audience of the designed smart workwear jacket. \nThe smart workwear jacket\u2019s system aims to inform a worker, a neighboring worker, or a \nsupervisor of any issues in real-time and with minimal configuration.\n\nWe separated two main use cases for the smart workwear system:\n\nModule with microcontroller unit (MCU) \nand basic environmental and motion \nsensors \n\nECG senses location\n\nMobile phone receives alarms via \nBluetooth\n\nFigure 2. \u201cMesh Network\u201d\n\nBasic modules, with MCU as part of \nmesh network\n\nMobile phones (part of mesh network)\n\nAdditional alarm module for alerts from \nneighbors like \u201cReplace mobile phone\u201d\n\n1\n\n1\n\n2\n\n2\n\n3\n\n3\n\nFigure 1. \u201cSupervisor-controlled\u201d\n\n\n\nwhitepaper | Smart Workwear for Safer Work 4\n\nIn the case of Figure 2, there is at least one actor in the system that has a smartphone \nand can check the status of each individual within the mesh network of the connected \nworkwear. The mesh network can also connect to the selected individual to gather detailed \ntelemetry data.\n\nThe smartphone\u2019s availability is optional. Smart workwear units connected in the mesh \nnetwork send alarm messages directly to the endangered worker\u2019s nearest neighbors, \nwith the aim of preventing accidents. The unit uses the same transport (BLE radio) as for \ncommunication with a smartphone.\n\nFigure 3. Workwear top-level system diagram\n\nAll units in the system are built around the top-level architecture from Figure 3, which \nconsists of several elements.

The \nECG contacts are made from conductive rubber with small resistance. The device\u2019s printed \ncircuit board (PCB) is in a plastic case in the front pocket of the jacket, the ECG contacts \nheader is also routed to this pocket.

The \nbattery charger (IC bq21040) charges the \nbattery from a USB port, and a low dropout \nvoltage regulator (LDK120) provides a stable \npower supply (3.3V, 200 mA) for all system \nelements. A user can get visual feedback \nfrom an RGB LED, or red-green-blue LED \nlight, that indicates the internal system \nstate. Additionally, there is \u201cpanic button\u201d \non the PCB for emergency notification \nalerts. The button is implemented as a \ncapacitive sensor on the top side of the \nplastic case. The buzzer supplements LED \nalerts indication with \u201cSOS\u201d signal.\n\nFigure 4.

The BLE device acts as a general attribute \n(GATT) server, providing a set of services to the smartphone with custom characteristics \n(a system status, a sensor data stream, an ECG stream, a battery level). A smartphone \ngets these characteristics as notifications. Simultaneously, it broadcasts status, \ntemperature, and humidity to the nearest devices.\n\n\n\nwhitepaper | Smart Workwear for Safer Work 6\n\n\u2022 The BLE device is not connected to a smartphone within an initial advertising interval. \nThe BLE device is configured as a GATT client that scans nearby Bluetooth devices \nfor the same \u201cworkwear\u201d name in the advertising packet. Upon detection, it checks \nthe neighbors\u2019 statuses and updates its own advertising package, if there is a need to \nspread this data. The system continues to broadcast the advertising packet. \n\nThe 12-bit SAR ADC has two channels to measure ECG analog signal (differential), as well \nas the battery charge level (single ended). The ADC sampling rate is 10,000 SPS; and the \ntransfer over the BLE notification packet sends 100 samples of ECG signals every 500 \nmilliseconds. For this purpose, we use a timer configured to get a sample every five \nmilliseconds to feed the buffering for notifications.\n\nSOFTWARE DETAILS \nReading the data from the smart workwear jacket is easy with the developed Android \napplication. Visualizing data from the sensors, the application has three main views:\n\nFigure 6. Smart WorkWear Android Application\n\nDiscovery Mode  Connected Status Connected Raw Data \n\nThe \u201cDiscovery Mode\u201d view appears at the application\u2019s start-up; it has a list of discovered \njacket devices and their statuses broadcasted in advertising packets.

The set of filters in the algorithms is used to \npass an ECG bandwidth of 5-15 Hz, reducing false detections caused by the various types \nof interference present in ECG signals, muscular noise, 50Hz wall supply, and others. This \nallows the reliable identification of R-peaks for calculating heart rate.\n\nMotion artifacts are a significant challenge for ECG processing, but the SoftServe R&D team \nhas experience using a \u201cde-noising\u201d technique to eliminate friction that is already planned \ninto the further stages of this research. Currently, we only detect heart rate using standard \nalgorithms, but research suggests that detecting cardiovascular diseases and emotional \nstate using ECG signal processing can be perfected.\n\nCONCLUSION \nUsage of these smart workwear jackets in groups working in harsh environments will \nimprove worker safety and monitoring. Using sensor technology, these jackets alert fellow \nworkers to impending accidents\u2014allowing time for the endangered worker to be saved by \nanother\u2014and alerting supervisors to health and environmental concerns and conditions \nin general. Such technology will be used to decrease risk due to accidents and health, and \nimprove the lives of workers overall.\n\nExplore the value of smart workwear solutions with SoftServe\u2014contact us today.\n\nhttps://www.softserveinc.com/en-us/contact/\n\n\nABOUT US\nSoftServe is a digital authority that advises and provides at the cutting-\nedge of technology.

Their existing \nplatform was expensive to maintain, difficult to manage and implementing changes were \nchallenging. Additionally, the timeframes were strict for project implementations and it \nwas critically important to not sacrifice the quality of specific customer implementation \nprojects.\n\n\n\ncase study 2|   Platform migration increases productivity, performance, and saves money\n\nEngagement Description\n\nThe client consulted with SoftServe and asked for assistance with two projects as they \nlacked the predictability of deliverables and suffered from quality issues. The SoftServe \nteam applied its phased approach to engage, starting with an analysis phase with the \ngoal of understanding existing code quality and creating immediate action items for \nimprovement.\n\nIn the next phase, SoftServe participated in a number of workshops with the business \nstakeholders to help define functional requirements and changes needed.\n\nThe team engaged in the following projects:\n\n\u2022  The migration from IBM WebSphere Commerce Platform to open-source stack\u2014\nEnterpriseDB Postgres Platform+GbOSS+getUI+Spring. \n\n\u2022 The other project is related to the client\u2019s data processing component, which is  visible \nand available to customers as part of a new platform. This component is a web \napplication enabling their customers to place orders. The end users of the app are \ncustomers working with the client in B2B relationships. \n\nThrough the app, customers can order labels, stickers with a specific look, content, size \nand more. The customer can also choose where and how the order is delivered, where \nthe payment is sent, and the country where it is produced. The configurations will vary \ndepending on each customer needs. \n\nThe project requirements focused on non-functional system requirements. To address \nthis, SoftServe pulled together a Scrum team that consisted of six developers, project \nmanager (PM), quality control (QC), and business analyst (BA). The client\u2019s project owner \n(PO), a technical manager, is responsible for backlog creation and prioritization. The team \ncommunicated with the PO in daily meetings and shared their practice of brainstorming \nduring every sprint, which was appreciated.\n\nThe unique part of this project is the client\u2019s focus on quality, which is an extremely high \npriority. As a result, the software development lifecycle (SDLC) was modified\u2014after coding \nprocess they freeze all activities and start testing.

However, like so many other technology trends, its \nevolution has roots that stretch back over decades.\n\nTo help make sense of the current landscape, the SoftServe Digital \nTransformation Report 2017 provides insights based on an examination of \nthe digital transformation strategies planned over the next 12 months by \na range of businesses and enterprise organizations. Most findings support \nearlier research, while some statistics were surprising. Chief among them, \nsecurity concerns are stopping 55 percent of organizations from committing \nto a digital transformation project. \n\nThe SoftServe Digital Transformation Report is based on a recent survey \ncompleted by 300 respondents, made up of 100 UK and 200 US decision-\nmakers. One hundred and fifty participants represented companies with \n1,000 to 3,000 employees, while the remaining participants represented \ncompanies with more than 3,000 employees. Respondents were \nbroken down into six key industries: business and professional services; \nmanufacturing; financial services; retail; distribution and transport; and other \ncommercial sectors. \n\nConducted in November 2016, the research asked a cross-industry panel of \nindustry leaders about the risks, challenges, and opportunities surrounding \ndigital transformation for modern businesses. \n\n\n\nsurvey report\n\nTHE SOFTSERVE DIGITAL TRANSFORMATION REPORT 2017 3\n\nThe Digital \nTransformation Landscape\nBuild understanding to drive implementation\n\nAwareness of digital transformation and the benefits that it \n\ndelivers are high across all verticals. However, the landscape \n\nis fragmented in terms of who has ultimate responsibility for \n\ndigital transformation strategies and where the true value lies. \n\nAll this uncertainty could account for the relatively low levels \n\nof complete adoption.\n\nAccording to IDC, the percentage of enterprises creating advanced digital \ntransformation initiatives will more than double by 2020, from 22 percent \nin 2015 to almost 50 percent by 20201 . While Gartner expects CIOs \nare typically already spending 18 percent of their budget in support of \ndigitalization, that figure is set to increase to 28 percent by 20182.\n\nIndeed, just one percent of organizations surveyed by SoftServe were \nunable to provide any kind of definition when asked: \u201cWhat does the term \n\u2018digital transformation\u2019 mean to you?\u201d\n\nOn the surface then it looks like digital transformation is well underway \neverywhere. When asked: \u201cTo what extent has a digital transformation \nstrategy been implemented in your business?\u201d just two percent of \nrespondents said they did not have a strategy and had no future plans to \nimplement one.\n\nA total of 27 percent of businesses claimed to have implanted a digital \ntransformation strategy across their entire organization. This figure seems \nhealthy at first glance. However, if we dig into the data, we find some big \ndifferences in adoption level - particularly across different regions.\n\n1. Predictions About The Future Of Digital Transformation; Forbes, Dec. 15, 2015.\n2.

But in the UK that figure is just 10 percent.\nThe difference between the levels of adoption in the \nUS and UK likely speaks to regulatory and cultural \ndifferences between the two counties.\n\nStarting a business in the US comes with significantly \nless red tape than in the UK. New businesses are \nmore likely to use disruptive technologies. They \nare not burdened by legacy solutions or opinions. \nIn order to keep pace with start-ups, established \nbusinesses in the US are more likely to turn to \ntransformative solutions.\n\nThings are a little different in the UK. With fewer \nstart-ups chipping away at the establishment, \nbusinesses are less inclined to adopt transformative \ntechnologies or practices. \n\nWhen it comes to digital transformation, \ncompetition drives innovation.\n\nIn the US, the number \n\nof organizations \n\nthat claim to have \n\nadopted complete \n\ntransformation \n\nstands at 33 percent. \n\nIn the UK, that figure \n\nis just 10 percent.\n\n25\n+2+27+46+M\n\n25 % 27 %\n\n46 %\n\nTo what extent has a digital \ntransformation strategy been \nimplemented in your organization?\n\nWe have one implemented across \nour whole organization\n\nWe have one implemented \nacross parts of our organization\n\nWe do not have one, but we are \nplanning to\n\nWe do not have one and have \nno plans to implement one\n\n\n\nsurvey report\n\nTHE SOFTSERVE DIGITAL TRANSFORMATION REPORT 2017 5\n\nIf we look across verticals, \u2018retail, distribution and \ntransport\u2019 leads the way in terms of complete \nadoption with 38 percent of businesses in \nthis sector claiming to have adopted digital \ntransformation across the whole organization - \nwhile just 18 percent of manufacturers claimed \ncomplete adoption.\n\nThe reason manufacturers find themselves behind \nthe curve when it comes to adopting digital \ntransformation may come down to a lack of agility. \n\nCompanies operating in the manufacturing sector \nare heavily siloed and have relatively high capital \nand operating expenses compared with businesses \nworking across retail, distribution, and transport. \nManufacturing is, therefore, a lot less agile than \nmore software-centric verticals such as financial \nservices or IT - which stand at 25 and 30 percent \nrespectively. Rather than transform, manufacturing \nis more likely to offshore work to regions that enjoy \nlower overheads.\n\nThe business and professional services vertical \nreports that 22 percent of organizations have \nadopted digital transformation across the board. \nThis vertical is reliant in human capital. With \nincremental improvements in artificial intelligence \nwe can expect to see this sector increasingly turning \nto digital solutions.\n\n\n\nsurvey report\n\nTHE SOFTSERVE DIGITAL TRANSFORMATION REPORT 2017 6\n\nPiecemeal adoption\n\nThe headline figures relating to complete adoption \ntell only half the story. The fact that nearly 50 \npercent of respondents have implemented \ntransformation across parts of their business shines \na light on the piecemeal approach that many are \ntaking.\n\nIt has parallels with the \u201cbring your own device\u201d \ntrend that shaped the enterprise mobility space \nin the years that followed the advent of the \nsmartphone. Individuals or smaller business units \nare more agile than entire organizations, it makes \nsense then that parts of the business will start to \nadopt disruptive technologies before the business \nat large.\n\nAs individuals or smaller parts of the business enjoy \nthe benefits delivered by digital transformation, we \ncan expect to see it being more widely adopted. In \nthis way, we\u2019ll see transformation happening from \nthe bottom up (or from the inside out) rather than \nthe more traditional command and control method. \nBut this approach runs the risk of becoming \nchaotic or haphazard. Ultimately, someone in \nthe organization needs to take responsibility. So \nwho will businesses turn to in order to make that \ntransition a success?\n\nThe fact that \n\nnearly 50 percent \n\nof respondents \n\nhave implemented \n\ntransformation across \n\nparts of their business \n\nshines a light on the \n\npiecemeal approach \n\nthat many are taking.\n\n\n\nsurvey report\n\nTHE SOFTSERVE DIGITAL TRANSFORMATION REPORT 2017 7\n\nCall in the experts\n\nMost businesses, it seems, are very inward looking when it comes to digital \ntransformation.\n\nWhen asked: \u201cWhen planning a digital transformation strategy in your \norganization, which resources do you/would you turn to for guidance and \nadvice?\u201d 76 percent of respondents stated that they would seek advice \nfrom experts within their business.\n\n28+28+20+13+6+5+M\n28.2 %\n\n27.9 %19.9 %\n\n13 %\n\n6 %\n5 %\n\nWhen planning a digital transformation strategy in your organization, \nwhich resources do you/would you turn to for guidance and advice?\n\nInternal IT expertise\n\nInternal IT and management expertise\n\nInternal management expertise\n\nIndustry analysts\n\nVendors\n\nMedia articles\n\nIn some ways, this makes perfect sense. These are the professionals \nwho know the business best, are familiar with the IT eco-system, the \noperational requirements and limitations of the business, and the people \nwho rely on the systems.\n\nAnd serving the people should not be overlooked as a consideration \nwhen it comes to digital transformation. You can probably count on the \nfingers of one hand the number of times a transformative IT infrastructure \nproject has been implemented where the employees have welcomed the \n\n\n\nsurvey report\n\nTHE SOFTSERVE DIGITAL TRANSFORMATION REPORT 2017 8\n\ndisruption and changes it brings. There is an almost \ninherent inertia among human beings when it \ncomes to change.\n\nThis touches on why so few businesses are adopting \ncomplete digital transformation. The people who are \narguably in the best position to drive transformation \nare not necessarily the people who ultimately benefit. \nIT doesn\u2019t just need to keep the ship afloat; it also \nneeds to keep it moving forward at full steam. More \noften than not, that results in businesses taking the \napproach that if things are not broken, they do not \nneed to be fixed. This is especially true at times of \neconomic hardship. Even now, the global economy \nis only just showing signs of recovery and IT budgets \nare set to stay flat in 20173 .\n\nSolutions, not products\n\nJust six percent of respondents felt that vendors \nwould be the best people to speak with for guidance \nor advice about digital transformation. This doesn\u2019t \nmean that people don\u2019t trust vendors; rather, it \nmeans they trust their internal experts more. That \nsaid, consumer trust in brands is at an all-time low4. \nThe fact that respondents trust vendors over the \nmedia speaks volumes.\n\nInternal stakeholders, while trusted, will however \nneed to turn to someone for advice. Those third \nparties are much more likely to be organizations that \nare not selling products in the space. Industry analysts \nand consultants that can help develop a solutions \nframework are well-placed to fill the knowledge void \nthat internal stakeholders might have.\n\nJust six percent of \n\nrespondents felt that \n\nvendors would be the \n\nbest people to speak \n\nwith for guidance or \n\nadvice about digital \n\ntransformation.\n\n3.

So while IT budgets \nare not set to rise in the immediate future, we \ncan at least be sure that the people who hold \nthe purse strings will be looking closely at digital \ntransformation initiatives when they consider how \nthose budgets will be allocated.\n\nLooking outside the C-suite, nearly one fifth of \nrespondents reported that their organization has \na dedicated digital transformation team. It is a \nreassuringly high percentage and chances are good \nthat the digital transformation team reports into \neither the CIO or CEO.\n\n25+24+20+18+7+3+1+2+M\n25.2 %\n\n23.8 %19.9 %\n\n7.3 %\n\n18.5 %\n\nWho within your organization has \nresponsibility for driving digital \ntransformation?\n\nA dedicated digital \ntransformation team\n\nCIO\n\nCEO\n\nCTO\n\nCFO\n\n*Other\n\nCMO\n\nI don\u2019t know\n\nNearly one fifth \nof respondents \nreported that their \norganization has \na dedicated digital \ntransformation team.\n\n\n\nsurvey report\n\nTHE SOFTSERVE DIGITAL TRANSFORMATION REPORT 2017 10\n\nWhere is the value?\n\nGiven the scope of digital transformation, it should come as no surprise \nthat respondents believe that it will deliver value to a wide range of \nbusiness areas, with almost equal weighting given to customer experience, \nmobile technologies, digital asset management, and Cloud computing. \nDigging into the data, retail showed a marked desire for customer \nexperience, but that is to be expected.\n\nThere will always be certain areas that benefit more than others from the \ndigital transformation. But the fact that it promises to add value across \nthe board suggests that businesses should concentrate on delivering \nwholesale adoption.\n\n14+13+13+13+11+11+9+6+4+3+3+M\n13.7 %\n\n13.5 %\n\n13 %\n\n12.8 %10.6 %\n\n9.4 %\n\n6.5 %\n\n10.6 %\n\nWhere do you see digital transformation providing value to your organization?\n\nCustomer experience/engagement\n\nMobile technologies\n\nDigital Asset Management\n\nCloud computing services\n\nData mining/analytics E-Commerce\n\nProduct Information \nManagement\n\nInternet \nof Things\n\nDevops Robotics\n\nWearables\n\nSecurity challenges\n\nDigital transformation promises to deliver greater levels of connectivity \nand more data than ever before, and businesses will also come to rely \nabsolutely on that connectivity and data. So, it is with good reason that \norganizations cite security as the number one challenge. In fact, security \n\n\n\nsurvey report\n\nTHE SOFTSERVE DIGITAL TRANSFORMATION REPORT 2017 11\n\nconcerns are stopping 55 percent of organizations \nfrom committing to a digital transformation project.\n\nSecurity will always be a key consideration with any \nnew IT initiatives, in fact it should be \u201cbaked in.\u201d \nIf there is any doubt about a company\u2019s existing \nsecurity strategy, then they should address that \nnow. The fact that digital transformation is not \nalways being carried out as part of an overall \nstrategy is a worry for the security conscious. Of \ncourse security, like everything else, is linked to \nbudgetary considerations.\n\nSo it is little wonder that budget is also viewed as a \nmajor challenge that businesses need to address. \nUnfortunately, as noted, IT budgets are not on the \nrise. Perhaps then, rather than positioning digital \ntransformation as an IT challenge, it should be \nconsidered a business objective, with budget set \naside accordingly.\n\nSecurity and \n\nbudgetary constraints \n\nare the two \n\nmain challenges \n\norganizations must \n\naddress to take \n\nadvantage of digital \n\ntrends.\n\nWhat challenges are impeding your organization from taking \nadvantage of digital trends?\n\nSecurity concerns\n\nBudget constraints\n\nLack of a strategy across the organization\n\nLack of required skills\n\nCompeting interests\n\nLack of willingness to take risks\n\nOrganizational inflexibility\n\nNot a collaborative culture\n\nLack of strong business case\n\nThere are no challenges\n\n0 %\n\n55\n\n50\n\n31\n\n27\n\n26\n\n22\n\n22\n\n11\n\n11\n\n4\n\n10 %% of respondents 20 % 30 % 40 % 50 % 60 %\n\n\n\nsurvey report\n\nTHE SOFTSERVE DIGITAL TRANSFORMATION REPORT 2017 12\n\nConclusion\n\nThe findings of the SoftServe Digital Transformation Report demonstrate \nthat while awareness of the need for, and an appreciation about the \nadvantages of, transformative technologies are high, levels of total \nadoption are relatively low.\n\nThe key to driving greater levels of implementation lies in transforming \nawareness into understanding. Once businesses understand how to \ndeliver transformative technologies, they will move forward quickly.\n\nHow SoftServe can help\n\nMost organizations know they need to bring digital transformation \nstrategies on board, but many struggle to envision a path forward. \nSoftServe helps modern enterprises adopt the disruptive technologies that \ndrive digital transformation with custom technology solutions. \n\n\n\nAbout SoftServe\n\nWith over 20 years of experience in digital software development and \nconsulting, SoftServe is a global leader in solving complex business \nproblems, creating industry disrupting technology and accelerating growth \nand innovation while optimizing operational efficiency.

With AWS \nRoboMaker\u2019s cutting-edge automated \ntesting for virtual environments, integrating \nnew features to your robots and confirming \nthat they work is easier than ever. \n\nTesting in robotics is as important \nas in other software development \ndomains. The sooner you find an \nissue, the easier it can be fixed. We \ncan divide software testing into two \ntypes: manual and automated tests. \n\nThe Case for Robot \nSoftware Automation \nTesting \n\n\n\nSolution Brief ROS Automation Testing for Wheeled and Legged Mobile Robots 3\n\nIn manual robotics testing, \nchallenges include: \n\nAutomated testing in a simulated \nvirtual environment allows you to: \n\nTest execution takes a lot of time Check robot behavior in a large \nnumber of environments with different \nscenarios, so one can find more \nbugs compare to a manual test \n\nManual tests cannot be easily scaled \nto different environments and \nrequire expensive hardware Provide software developers with \n\nmore immediate feedback about \ntheir applications and if they match \nwith correct robot behavior \n\n\n\nSolution Brief ROS Automation Testing for Wheeled and Legged Mobile Robots 4\n\nThere are multiple ways to classify \nthe automation tests. In general, the \ntests can be split into two groups:  \n\nAutomated tests may be split \ninto the following groups: \n\nFunctional tests. Refer to the ability \nof the robot to accomplish the task \naccording to the business logic that has \nbeen implemented in the solution \n\nSmoke tests that cover the most \ncrucial robot functionality that can be \npromptly tested to ensure the robot\u2019s \nstable behavior during further tests \n\nNon-functional tests. Validate the robot\u2019s \nresource consumption, data storage, \ndata streaming capabilities, and other \n\nIntegration tests that validate the \nfunctionality of the solution when \nall distributed robot components \nare executed together \n\nRegression tests that ensure the robot\u2019s \nboth functional and non-functional \ncharacteristics are not negatively \naffected by the most recent changes \n\n\n\nSolution Brief ROS Automation Testing for Wheeled and Legged Mobile Robots 5\n\nAutomated tests may be split \ninto the following groups: \n\nSecurity tests aim to reveal the \nvulnerability of the software during robot \noperations under various conditions \n\nThe test phases are generally \nsplit into three stages:  \n\n1. Unit tests when each individual \ncomponent is tested \n\n2. Hardware integration tests \n\n3. Business logic conformity tests \n\nUsing automated tests in simulated virtual \nenvironments allows you to decrease \ndevelopment and maintenance costs as \nwell as save costs during hardware tests. \n\nBenefits of AWS RoboMaker \n\nWith multiple ways of orchestrating \nautomated tests, o but AWS RoboMaker \nis one of the most convenient for \nimplementation. It is a fully managed \nsimulation service for running robot \napplications in a simulated virtual \nenvironment. You can seamlessly integrate \nyour robot automation tests with AWS \nCodePipeline (or to other AWS services) \nand run them during the CI/CD process. \n\nPerformance tests are usually \ndevoted to non-functional robot \nperformance ensuring stable, and \nresponsive behavior of the robot \n\nAcceptance tests are final tests of \nrobot\u2019s functional behavior prior \nto final approval and release \n\n\n\nSolution Brief ROS Automation Testing for Wheeled and Legged Mobile Robots 6\n\nAWS RoboMaker supports large-scale \nand parallel simulations, so you can \neasily run a wide variety of simulations \nand receive results much faster than \nusing own hardware for that. \n\nAnd with its pay-as-you-go pricing model, \nyou only pay for resources used, without \nthe need to think about hardware and \nhow to scale it. AWS RoboMaker provides \nall the resources needed for a single \nsimulation or for dozens of simulations \nin the same way, using a single API call.  \n\nDepending on your robot type, it could \nrequire a unique set of tests. For example, \ntests for drones are not as efficient when \napplied to ground mobile platforms, \nand vice versa. Best practice is to divide \nall tests into several parts. with each \npart responsible for testing specific \nrobot components such as its planner, \nlocalization, and others. Let\u2019s take a \ncloser look at each one of these tests. \n\nTypes of Tests\n\nSLIPPAGE AND MOTOR \n\nSATURATION TESTS \n\nPLANNING \n\nTESTS \n\nBEHAVIOR \n\nTESTS  \n\nLOCALIZATION \n\nTESTS \n\nSuch tests are conducted \nto check the work of motor \ndrivers and algorithms. \nThese tests could check \nif the robot does not \nmove without commands \nor whether the robot's \nmovements are precise \nenough. \n\nWith planning tests, we \ncan check the work of the \nrobot navigation planner \nand easily fix a bug when \nthe planner creates a new \nroute when we ask it to go \nto a certain point where \nwe are located. \n\nWith behavior tests, \nwe check the robot\u2019s \nbehavior under different \ncircumstances. Such tests \ninclude, but not limited \nto, obstacle avoidance \ntesting, coverage testing, \nand moving from point A \nto point B. \n\nLocalization tests help us \ncheck whether the robot \ncan successfully localize \nitself on a known map, \nallowing us to control the \nrobot localization stack. \n\nWe will show what tests \nare useful for ground \nmobile robots. In our \nexamples we use scenario-\nbased testing, as it allows \nus to easily parametrize \neach test and integrate \nrobot simulation tests into \nCI/CD process.  \n\nhttps://aws.amazon.com/blogs/robotics/building-a-ros-application-ci-pipeline-with-aws-robomaker/\nhttps://aws.amazon.com/blogs/robotics/building-a-ros-application-ci-pipeline-with-aws-robomaker/\n\n\nSolution Brief ROS Automation Testing for Wheeled and Legged Mobile Robots 7\n\nSoftServe\u2019s robotics group developed a \nlist of ROS1 tests suitable for any mobile \nrobot running in 2D. Here\u2019s how to run the \ntests for the quadruped robot Spot from \nBoston Dynamics. The control of multi-\nlegged robots is significantly different from \nthe control of robots with wheels or other \ntypes of locomotion. However, the above-\nmentioned types of tests are quite generic \nand relate to high-level control testing or \nrobot-environment testing. Therefore, the \n\ntests can be easily adapted to the robot \nregardless of the type of its locomotion.  \n\nBoston Dynamics\u2019 Spot is one of the \nmost advanced legged robots available \non the market. It can perform navigation \nmissions, move on difficult terrains, \nclimb stairs, carry payloads, and other. \nYou can find out more about the full \nfunctionality of Boston Dynamics\u2019 Spot on \ntheir official website or read our blog.  \n\nHow to Run the Tests \nfor Boston Dynamics\u2019 \nSpot  \n\nhttps://github.com/SoftServeSAG/aws_ros_tests\nhttps://github.com/SoftServeSAG/aws_ros_tests\nhttps://github.com/SoftServeSAG/aws_ros_spot_test\nhttps://github.com/SoftServeSAG/aws_ros_spot_test\nhttps://www.bostondynamics.com/spot\nhttps://www.bostondynamics.com/spot\nhttps://www.softserveinc.com/en-us/blog/spot-simulation-tools\n\n\nSolution Brief ROS Automation Testing for Wheeled and Legged Mobile Robots 8\n\nToday, the robot is used in such areas \nas pipeline inspection, construction \ninspection, healthcare, and others. To \nensure Spot\u2019s reliability for your specific \nmission, it must be tested beforehand. \nFor that, AWS RoboMaker can be used. \n\nParts of the Code \n\nTo test the robot on the AWS \nRoboMaker, you need to have:  \n\n\u2022 Robot simulation package with a \ncontrol system and navigation stack. \n\n\u2022 Test package \n\n\u2022 A package that contains scripts \nthat create the cloud formation \n\n\u2022 Test launcher that runs test scripts \nwith the required launch files \n\nSoftServe\u2019s robotics group repository \nScenario-based Tests with AWS RoboMaker \nfor Boston Dynamics' Spot allows you \nto run tests with just one click. The \nrepository consists of the simulation \ntool, package with tests, cloud formation \nsetup scripts, and test launch scripts. \nBased on this example, you can easily \nadopt scripts for your application because \nof the repo\u2019s modular structure.\n\nThe simulation for Spot is implemented \non the basis of the open-source package \nchamp, which is designed to develop \nthe control of the legged robots and \ncontains a preconfigured package for \nthe Spot simulation. The repository \nincludes navigation and localization \nstacks, allows you to control the walk of \nthe robot and the positioning of its body \nrelative to the limbs. We have made the \nnecessary improvements to be able to \nrun the champ on AWS RoboMaker. \n\nThe cloud formation scripts set up \nall the AWS resources needed for \nautomated testing on your behalf.  \n\nhttps://github.com/SoftServeSAG/aws_ros_spot_test\nhttps://github.com/SoftServeSAG/aws_ros_spot_test\nhttps://github.com/chvmp/champ\n\n\nSolution Brief ROS Automation Testing for Wheeled and Legged Mobile Robots 9\n\nThe test launcher aims to launch all needed \nnodes for test running and launching \nthe test as well. The simulation tool is \nsplit into the simulation environment \nsimulation_ws and robot environment \nrobot_ws. In order to launch a test, you \nshould launch the required package \nfor testing from both environments. \nAs such, we created directories which \ninclude launch files to do that. For \nexample, in order to run an obstacle \navoidance test, you need to run Gazebo \nwith a robot model and test script in a \nsimulation environment, while in a robot \nenvironment, you should run navigation \nand localization stacks. Examples of \nsuch launch files are given below.\n\n    <arg name=\"mode\" default=\"dynamic\"/> \n\n    <node pkg=\"softserve_simulation_\ncommon\" type=\"move_base_route_\nmanager.py\" name=\"move_base_\nroute_manager\" output=\"screen\"> \n\n    </node> \n\n    <include file=\"$(find mp_\nbehaviour_tests)/launch/obstacle_\navoidance_test.launch\" > \n\n        <arg name=\"path_topic\" \nvalue=\"$(arg path_topic)\"/> \n\n    </include> \n\n</launch> <launch> \n\n    <arg name=\"gui\" default=\"false\"/> \n\n    <arg name=\"path_topic\" default=\"/\nmove_base/GlobalPlanner/plan\"/> \n\n         <param name=\"use_sim_\ntime\" value=\"true\" /> \n\n    <include file=\"$(find rs_config)/\nlaunch/gazebo.launch\" > \n\n        <arg name=\"gui\" default=\"$(arg gui)\" /> \n\n    </include> \n\nLaunch File in the Simulation Environment \n\n\n\nSolution Brief ROS Automation Testing for Wheeled and Legged Mobile Robots 10\n\nWhen the launch files are ready, \nyou can run your test on the AWS \nRoboMaker platform. How can you \nrun many different tests in different \nenvironment conditions at scale? For \nthat, you should write test scenarios. \n\nTest Scenarios \n\nThe scenario consists of a set of parameters \nthat define environment conditions, robot \nbehaviors, and expected outcomes. AWS \nRoboMaker allows you to run hundreds of \nsimulation tests with different scenarios \nat scale. Take a look at the JSON file to \nconfigure the coverage test given below.  \n\nThe coverage test shows the efficiency \nof the robot's ability to cover the floor of \nthe environment. Here, the test-related \nparameter is ROBOT_COVERAGE_TEST_\nCOVERAGE_GOAL which determines \nthe coverage goal. You can set different \ngoal values for different scenarios. \n\n<launch> \n\n    <arg name=\"gui\" default=\"false\"/> \n\n    <param name=\"use_sim_\ntime\" value=\"true\" /> \n\n    <include file=\"$(find rs_navigation)/\nlaunch/navigate.launch\" > \n\n        <arg name=\"map_file\" value=\"$(find \naws_robomaker_small_house_world)/\nmaps/turtlebot3_waffle_pi/map.yaml\"/> \n\n        <arg name=\"rviz\" value=\"$(arg gui)\" /> \n\n    </include> \n\n</launch> \n\nLaunch File in the Robot Environment \n\n\n\nSolution Brief ROS Automation Testing for Wheeled and Legged Mobile Robots 11\n\n{ \n   \"scenarios\":{ \n      \"Scenario1\":{ \n         \"simEnvironmentVariables\":{ \n            \"MODEL_NAME\":\"/\", \n            \"START_X\":\"0\", \n            \"START_Y\":\"0\", \n            \"START_Z\":\"0.0\", \n            \"START_YAW\":\"0\", \n            \"ROBOT_COVERAGE_TEST_\nCOVERAGE_GOAL\":\"80\" \n         }, \n         \"robotEnvironmentVariables\":{ \n            \"MODEL_NAME\":\"/\", \n            \"START_X\":\"0\", \n            \"START_Y\":\"0\", \n            \"START_Z\":\"0.0\", \n            \"START_YAW\":\"0\" \n         } \n      }, \n      \"Scenario2\":{ \n         \"simEnvironmentVariables\":{ \n            \"MODEL_NAME\":\"/\", \n            \"START_X\":\"0\", \n            \"START_Y\":\"0\", \n            \"START_Z\":\"0.0\", \n            \"START_YAW\":\"0\", \n            \"ROBOT_COVERAGE_TEST_\nCOVERAGE_GOAL\":\"10\" \n         }, \n         \"robotEnvironmentVariables\":{ \n            \"MODEL_NAME\":\"/\", \n            \"START_X\":\"0\", \n            \"START_Y\":\"0\", \n            \"START_Z\":\"0.0\", \n            \"START_YAW\":\"0\" \n         } \n      } \n\n   }, \n   \"simulations\":[ \n      { \n         \"scenarios\":[ \n            \"Scenario1\",  \n            \"Scenario2\" \n         ], \n         \"params\":{ \n            \"failureBehavior\": \"Fail\", \n             \"maxJobDurationInSeconds\": 600, \n            \"simulationApplications\":[ \n               { \n                  \"applicationVersion\": \"$LATEST\", \n                  \"launchConfig\":{ \n                     \"launchFile\":\"coverage_\ntest.launch\", \n                     \"packageName\":\"rs_tests\" \n                  } \n               } \n            ], \n            \"robotApplications\":[ \n               { \n                  \"applicationVersion\": \"$LATEST\", \n                  \"launchConfig\":{ \n                     \"launchFile\":\"coverage_\ntest.launch\", \n                     \"packageName\":\"rs_robot_tests\" \n                  } \n               } \n            ], \n            \"vpcConfig\": { \n               \"assignPublicIp\": true \n            } \n         } \n      } \n   ] \n} \n\nJSON file to configure the coverage test\n\n\n\nSolution Brief ROS Automation Testing for Wheeled and Legged Mobile Robots 12\n\nRun Test \n\nIn order to run a test, you should execute \nthe following command in an IDE terminal: \n\ncd ~/environment/aws _ ros _\ntests./run.sh test _ launch _\njson/<json _ file _ name>.json\n\nFor example, run the coverage test: \n\ncd ~/environment/aws _ ros _\ntests./run.sh test _ launch _\njson/coverage _ test.json\n\nThis command launches two Simulation \nJobs picking parameters determined in \ncoverage_test.json file for two scenarios. \nWhen the jobs are complete, you will see \nthe test results tagged to the simulation \njobs.

For example, in video 4, you \ncan see how the robot navigates \nand localizes itself when the objects \ndisappeared from their initial position.  \n\nThe test verifies whether a localization tool \nlocates the robot pose correctly when the \npredefined amount of the world's objects \nis deleted or moved to predefined poses. \n\nYou can specify which object should be \nmoved/deleted and their final destination \nwhen the Move option is activated.  \n\nDuring the test, the robot navigates \nthrough the predefined or random \npoints on the map until the robot has \nreached all points or timeout occurred. \nThe test is marked as Failed, if a timeout \nhas occurred or predefined points were \nreached, and the robot did not localize \nitself with desired tolerance. The test is \nmarked as Passed, if a robot localizes \nitself with predefined accuracy before \ntimeout or all points were reached, and \nthe robot localizes itself correctly.  \n\nVideo 4.

They have over 10,000 \nemployees who work across more than \n1,000 micro-fulfillment centers.  \n\nThe Business Case \n\nOur client wanted to expand their \nbusiness and services across Canada \nand Europe. That\u2019s why they sought \n\nout a partner that could quickly localize \ntheir applications into German, French, \nSpanish, and UK and Canadian English.  \n\nThe Challenges \n\nWhen the SoftServe team began \ntheir discovery, they uncovered a \nfew challenges facing their team.  \n\nFirst, the client\u2019s aggressive deadlines and \nrequired live release roadmap alignment \nmeant an extremely fast turnaround. With \nhardcoded localization strings, our team \nwas unable to see the full project scope \nor estimate the time it might take. Yet, our \nclient\u2019s deadline was definitive with the \nSoftServe team having only two months to \ntake this project from start to finish. \n\nThe Solution  \n\nSoftServe has experience with tight \ndeadlines and seemingly impossible \ntasks. After the two-week discovery \n\nperiod, our team built a solid workflow that \nsuccessfully delivered the localization our \nclient needed within their timeline. \n\nTypically, a localization project\u2019s workflow \nwould start with the localization team \nreceiving the strings which they would \nthen share with the translation vendor \nto be translated. Next, the localization \nteam would get back the translations from \nthe vendor, review them, and deliver the \ntranslated strings for implementation.  \n\nThe next challenge was the extensive and \nvaried amounts of information requiring \nlocalization into five separate languages. \nThis not only required localizing the \ncustomer facing application for online \norder processing, but it also required \nlocalizing the supporting apps for order \ninventory, scheduling, drivers, the website, \nAndroid and iOS frameworks, email, SMS \nnotifications, award and discount policies, \nand more. \n\nLastly, the client, the localization team, and \nthe translators were spread across different \ntime zones, so collaboration was more \ndifficult.  \n\nCase Study |   Five Language Localization Project Drives Client's Successful Global Expansion 2\n\nDiscover how SoftServe successfully delivered web and mobile application \nlocalization in five languages despite hardcoded strings and a tight deadline. \n\n\n\nLET\u2019S TALK if you\u2019re ready to drive \nsuccessful localization projects even under \ncomplicated conditions. \n\nThe Outcome  \n\nW ith SoftServe successfully delivering \nlocalized apps in five different \nlanguages, our client was able to \n\nmeet their launch deadlines and business \ngoals. SoftServe also internationalized \nthe previously hardcoded strings so that \nany future localization projects would be \nsignificantly faster and easier. Now that our \nclient has expanded across Canada and \nEurope, they are poised for further financial \nand structural growth. \n\nHowever, this project\u2019s hardcoded strings \nand tight turnaround time required a \ndifferent workflow. First, hardcoded \nstrings meant our development team had \nto manually extract them from the app, \nwith our localization team then providing \nthe German translation while the vendors \ncovered the other languages. \n\nAs the vendor had engaged native \nspeakers, there were significant time \ndifferences between translators. This \nmeant it was essential these translators \nreceived the strings ASAP in order to meet \nthe deadline. In addition, this project \ninvolved continuous localization, meaning \nnew strings were coming in at all hours \nof the day and night while translating was \nongoing.  \n\nThankfully, the use of a localization tool \nmade file management significantly easier. \nThe process was further streamlined by \nhaving automatic translation memory, \nwhere commonly used words or phrases \nwould be stored so they didn\u2019t require \ntranslation each time. \n\nDespite the challenges, the translations \nwere delivered within the deadlines. The \nSoftServe QA team then continuously \ntested both the translations and process \nflows, fixing any translation-related bugs \nbefore integration. Once thoroughly tested \nand integrated, the localized applications \nand services were launched.  \n\nCase Study |   Five Language Localization Project Drives Client's Successful Global Expansion 3\n\nhttps://www.softserveinc.com/en-us/contact\n\n\nABOUT SOFTSERVE\n\nWe are a digital authority made up of advisors, engineers, and designers \nwho deliver innovation, quality, and speed to elevate and accelerate our \nclients\u2019 digital journeys.\n\nOur approach is built on a foundation of empathetic, human-focused \nexperience design that ensures value and continuity from concept to \nrelease.\n\nWE IDENTIFY WHERE YOU ARE.                   \nWE PREPARE YOU FOR THE ROAD AHEAD.\u00a0 \nWE TAKE YOU WHERE YOU NEED TO GO.\u00a0\nVisit our website, blog, LinkedIn, Facebook, and Twitter pages.\n\nNORTH AMERICAN HQ\n\n201 W 5th Street, Suite 1550 \nAustin, TX 78701 \nUSA +1 866 687 3588 (USA)           \n+1 647 948 7638 (Canada) \n\nEUROPEAN HQ\n\n30 Cannon Street\nLondon EC4M 6XH\nUnited Kingdom  \n+44 333 006 4341\n\ninfo@softserveinc.com \nwww.softserveinc.com\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/SoftServeCompany\n\n", "LocationURL": "https://www.softserveinc.com/files/cases/five-language-localization-project-drives-clients-successful-global-expansion.pdf", "id": "sw-rf-833", "FileName": "five-language-localization-project-drives-clients-successful-global-expansion.pdf", "Storage": "SoftServe Website", "Published": "2022-06-24T06:48:15Z", "FileType": ".pdf"}, {"Category": null, "content": "\nSmart er \nDIGITAL PATIENT \nENGAGEMENT\n\nby using sources like social media, digital exhaust, \ninternet personas, and other social determinants \nof health and public records information to \ndevelop better relationships between people and \nsystems of healthcare.

As the company has moderated its \nwork using AWS console only, it aimed to \nget the resources being deployed using \nautomated pipelines and to keep all the \ninfrastructure as code (IaC) in GitLab \nrepositories. SoftServe got the request \nto design an efficient security solution as \nthe client\u2019s experience in AWS Cloud was \nlimited. \n\ncase study Secure AWS Landing Zone With OpenSearch as a SIEM 2\n\n\n\nS oftServe analyzed the client's \ninfrastructure and business goals \nand devised the exact action plan. \n\nDuring the verification stage, our team of \nexperts focused on corresponding to the \nrequirements of all security standards. \nThis helped us to propose a powerful and \nworkable solution for the client. \n \nAs the company had only two AWS \naccounts, the most efficient practice \nwas to build a multi-account structure in \nAWS, where it wanted to migrate both \u2014 \nthe new company infrastructure and its \nexisting assets. The SoftServe team started \nby designing the secure architecture \nsolution preparation.  \n \nOur next big step was creating the \nIaC secure AWS Landing Zone code in \nTerraform, where we could place every \nminor configuration. For this, our team of \nexperts built a secure pipeline with KMS \nencryption, where only permitted users \ncould have access and enforce changes to \nthe production. Having deep experience \nin the security cloud domain, we used \na significant number of AWS Services \nin the Terraform code: AWS GuardDuty, \nAWS Security Hub, AWS Security Control \nPolicy, AWS Organization, AWS SSO, AWS \nKMS, AWS Secret Manager, AWS System \n\nManager, AWS Config, AWS VPC, EC2, S3. \nThe SoftServe security team also designed \narchitecture for security information \nand event management (SIEM) service \nusing OpenSearch built in AWS. AWS \nOpenSearch has all the logs gathered in \none place from the entire organization. \nWith the usage of Lambda functions and \nKinesis Data Streams, the security data \nlogs were pushed straight forward to the \nOpenSearch from many services like AWS \nCloudTrail, GuardDuty, SecurityHub, and \nVPC flows.  \n \nTo detect any potential incidents on the \nclient\u2019s infrastructure, the SoftServe \ndevelopers designed two Slack channels: \none for security audit notifications and \nanother for providing details about the \nguard duty findings. In this way, we were \nable to form an incident notification \ncenter that facilitated identifying any \nattack attempts. This solution was \nhighly profitable as our client was not \nexperienced in AWS Cloud.  \n \nWithin the process, SoftServe encountered \nthe dilemma of a short period for the \nimplementation \u2014 up to five months. \nNevertheless, our experts enabled us to \nenroll a dozen of high-standard security \ntools.\n\n Solution\n\ncase study Secure AWS Landing Zone With OpenSearch as a SIEM 3\n\n\n\ncase study Secure AWS Landing Zone With OpenSearch as a SIEM 4\n\nAs a result of our partnership, the client reached the initial goal of getting a fully \nprotected security environment.

The company is a \nmulti-solutions corporation that pro-\n\ncess all types of payments, including alter-\nnative payment solutions for e-commerce \nmerchants, debit and credit card processing \nservices, wallets, prepaid cards and vouch-\ners, direct debit payments, off-line pay-\nments support, and more. A sizeable part of \ntheir portfolio is a B2B segment. They offer \nturn-key solutions, integrating payments \nprocessing modules into enterprise systems \nthroughout various industries.\n\nBusiness Challenge\n\nOne of our clients major customers \n(merchant) was developing a new \nwebservice layer for their platform. \n\nThis new layer had already been connected \nto various competitor\u2019s payment partners. \nAlthough our client had one point of \nintegration with its customer\u2019s platform, its \ntechnology team were too slow to imple- \nment some of the payment processor risk \nmanagement product and features. This \nresulted in instances of authorization issues \nand transactions being declined. Our client \nwas at risk of losing its position of preferred \npartner with this customer.\n\nProject Description\n\nT he project required the development \nof a solution that integrated our client\u2019s \nmodules with the software from the \n\nclient partner\u2019s side.\n\nTo design the system properly during the \ndiscovery phase, SoftServe conducted \na series of workshops that included the \nfollowing activities: \n\n\u2022 An audit of the client\u2019s system, focusing \non architecture and security issues \n\n\u2022 A feasibility study of the integration of \nthe two systems \n\n\u2022 Mapping out the best way to integrate \nthe systems (architecture vision and \nsystems functional requirements issues)\n\n\u2022 Identifying limitations and best ap- \nproaches testing recommendations\n\nThe solution introduced by SoftServe is a  \nconnector integrating the client\u2019s processing \nsystem UI and their partner\u2019s input data \nsystem. When the merchant initiates a trans-\naction, it calls the SoftServe component and \ntransmits all the data about purchase/trans-\naction. The component transforms the trans-\naction information to make it compatible with \nclient\u2019s secure risk management feature. Then \nthe component calls the client\u2019s security  \nfeature API to submit the data from the \nmerchant. Thus, the transaction can be \nsecurely validated by the payment processor \nand completed.\n\nThe solution is fully hosted and supported \nby SoftServe, giving the client additional \noperational flexibility and internal resources \nfor other projects.\n\n5\n\n5\n\n5\n\n5\n\ncase study |    Successful End-To-End Partner Integration for  \n      Leading Payment Processing Enterprise \n\n2\n\n\n\nFor the solution, it was crucial to satisfy \nseveral main parameters (quality attributes), \nsuch as reliability, security, and availability. \nSecurity is mainly supported via SSL (HTTPS), \nthe payment processor\u2019s product internally \nchecks and verifies the components for PCI \nstandard compliance. Availability represents, \nby default, a clustered environment with \nload balancer.

Benefits of \ncooperation included: \n\n\u2022 Deep analysis of the solution\u2019s architec-\ntural structure \n\n\u2022 Validation of the feasibility of the \nintegration request\n\n\u2022 A fully developed solution integrating \nthe client\u2019s payment system with the \npartner\u2019s services system \n\n\u2022 Proof of concept implementation to \ndecrease risks and costs before full \nscope system development \n\n\u2022 Hosting the solution and fully integrated \nprocesses after implementation \n\n\u2022 Taking the load from the in-house \nteam creating extra capacity for other \ninitiatives\n\n\u2022 Allowing the company IT department to \nfocus on things other than the mainte-\nnance of supportive products \n\nThe solution developed by SoftServe also \nenables our client\u2019s system to send void \nmessages concerning payment processing \nfrom any stage of the payment authen-\ntication process\u2014an additional market \nadvantage. \n\ncase study |    Successful End-To-End Partner Integration for  \n      Leading Payment Processing Enterprise \n\n3\n\n\n\nABOUT US\nSoftServe is a digital authority that advises and provides at the \ncutting-edge of technology.

More and more people \nevery year are embracing the idea of actively participating in their own health monitoring \nand management. This trend is revolutionizing healthcare ecosystems in the US and beyond. \nBut any ecosystem is only as good as its constituent companies and patient participants. \n\nToday, forward-thinking healthcare companies and medical management businesses \nare facing the same questions: How can I contribute to facilitating positive patient \nengagement, both physically and digitally? How will my company benefit from improved \npatient engagement? And, how do I eliminate the weak links in my ecosystem? \n\nFor many, the answers begin with more efficient use of the latest consumer-oriented \ntechnologies that create user-friendly experiences, attract more patients to engage with \nhealthcare ecosystems on a regular basis, and result in benefits for all members.\n\n!\n\nWhat do patients want\n\nPatients today want easy-to-use portals to make appointments and access their electronic \nhealth records and test results. They want predictive statistical analysis and risk scoring, \nbased on the data submitted from their wearables, smart devices, and home sensors.  \nThey want mobile doctor visits, efficient preventive care, and an overall streamlined \ntreatment process. By using technology to its full potential, healthcare and medical \nmanagement companies can make these expectations a reality. \n\nBut doing so does impose new demands on everyone. For example, to improve medication \nadherence and patient engagement, pharmacies can now use technology, including virtual \nassistants and smart pill boxes, to provide reminders and guarantee timely refills, as well \nas maximize medication synchronization.\n\nUsing patient-reported data from wearables and smart devices can now enable healthcare \ncompanies to engage with patients more effectively, and focus on developing and \nproviding precision medications for specific health conditions, by reflecting each individual \npatient\u2019s lifestyle, living environment, and even genes. \n\n\n\nwhitepaper | Are You the Weak Link in Patient Engagement? 3\n\nBenefits for every business\n\nPatients are certainly not the only ones standing to benefit from efficient engagement \nwith the healthcare ecosystem. Better patient engagement leads to improved medication \nadherence, which, in turn, leads to faster treatment outcomes and considerable savings for \nhospitals and other healthcare providers. According to a recent analysis published in the \nAnnals of Internal Medicine, non-adherence costs US healthcare providers from $100 to \n$289 billion each year, an estimated 10% of hospitalizations, and 125,000 deaths.\n\nOn a larger scale, patient health data aggregated across many geographic locations could \ncertainly be used to reveal wider patterns, offering rich opportunities for new healthcare \nresearch and treatment solutions.\n\nLooking ahead, the vision for patient engagement is promising and positive. That said \nthere are many \u201cweak links\u201d that healthcare providers, pharmacies, health insurance, and \nmedical management companies will need to resolve before turning this vision into reality, \nand bringing a seamless experience to fruition.   \n\nEngage with IT experience\n\nSoftServe is already working with healthcare and medical management companies to \nprovide technology solutions that help to enhance patient engagement.\n\nFor example,\n\n\u2022 We have leveraged machine learning and cognitive computing for multiple clients, \nenabling a more efficient and effective communication model.\n\n\u2022 We have built applications and restructured healthcare providers\u2019 portals to make \nthem more user-friendly.\n\n\u2022 We have helped to transform healthcare delivery through virtual reality, assistive \ntechnology, and voice technology.\n\nWe would be happy to engage with you.

Technology is empowering sales teams to identify,\ntrack, and engage prospects more efficiently than ever. In order to maximize returns on\ncustomer acquisition investments, companies need to consider calculated adoption of\ndata-driven technology. And they need to do it today.\n\nClosing new business is clearly vital for every company, but what about those customers\nwho require no \u201chunting\u201d to reach? In the search for new revenue, loyal customers, brand\nadvocates, and die-hard fanatics are often given less attention\udbc0\ude03if not ignored altogether.\n\nThis white paper reviews:\n\n\u2022 Why likes, follows, and shares are not indicative of future success \n\u2022 The differences between a loyalist, advocate, and fanatic\n\u2022 How technology should be leveraged to convert existing customers into brand fanatics\n\nA like is not a like, is not a like \n\nIt is no small task for a company to earn a customer, but in today\u2019s society, consumers are\nincreasingly inclined to consider a \u201clike\u201d to be all the advocacy needed. To be successful,\nbrands need to deliver consistent, relevant engagements and genuine personalization that\ninspires actions beyond clicks.\n\nBrand Fanaticism 2.0 is brand advocacy driven by genuine personalization, powered by\ntechnology, and future-proofed by agility and innovation.\n\n\u2022 It is not grown through increased ad spend in the face of declining organic social reach\n\u2022 It is not overrun by the cost of digital advertising rising faster than inflation\n\u2022 It is a remedy to rising ad blocker usage and ad blindness\n\nPositive word-of-mouth recommendations are the most enduring marketing tool ever\ncreated. Recommendations from family, friends, and peers are still trusted by 92% of\nthe population today. The challenge is how to earn consumer loyalty and then refer\nyour brand to countless consumers in a saturated marketplace with declining consumer\ntrust and attention spans. The solution is a personalized engagement strategy that\ncreates a brand loyalist, converts him or her into an advocate, and ultimately into a vocal\nand active brand champion.\n\nhttp://www.nielsen.com/us/en/insights/news/2009/global-advertising-consumers-trust-real-friends-and-virtual-strangers-the-most.html\nhttp://www.nielsen.com/us/en/insights/news/2009/global-advertising-consumers-trust-real-friends-and-virtual-strangers-the-most.html\n\n\nwhitepaper | Why Today\u2019s Brands Need Fanatics Not Loyalists 3\n\nBut sustainable brand fanaticism requires solid fundamentals.\n\nMarket conditions and consumer paradigms are irrevocably changing the status quo. Without\noptimized brand, mobile, and integrated communications strategies, most companies have\nlittle chance of sustainable success. These are fundamental tenets, not innovations.\n\nTo effectively compete, brands must also:\n\nConsolidate silos and disparate data\nOptimal marketing today requires optimized first-, second-, and third-party data. If data\nlives in silos and isn\u2019t managed properly for quality and gaps then genuine \npersonalization is impossible. In the absence of personalization, marketing waste \n(dollars, time, effort) will follow.\n\nMigrate to the Cloud for agility\nMigration to the cloud is inevitable for any business serving customers beyond\nits neighborhood. Each business must determine whether public, private, or a hybrid cloud\nsolution is best, but migration is a must for the agility needed to keep pace with\ntechnological and personalization progress.\n\nProvide Relevant and frictionless experiences\nMost media managers would agree that experience is king in a world where the consumer\n\u2014not the brand\u2014dictates relevance and future sustainability. In fact, when a consumer is\ngiven a genuinely personalized experience she is 10 times more likely to be a brand\u2019s\nmost valuable customer, typically making more than 15 transactions in one year.\n\nMastering these fundamentals can generate likes, followers, and quality leads that equip \nsales and marketing teams to more effectively capture new prospects and revenue. Not \nevery customer will become a fan, and not every fan is guaranteed to remain one, but \nfundamentals do not guarantee fanaticism.\n\nLoyalty is dead \u2013 long live loyalty! \n\nIf you think brand loyalty is dead, think again. Generation X is more brand loyal than both \nBaby Boomers and Millennials, but Generation Y and Z are more open to loyalty programs \nif technology allows for the right personalization. \n\n#1\n\nhttps://www.slideshare.net/EpsilonMktg/the-power-of-me-the-impact-of-personalization-on-marketing-performance/1\nhttps://www.retaildive.com/ex/mobilecommercedaily/brand-loyalty-highest-in-gen-x-consumers-emarketer\nhttps://www.bondinsights.com/the-loyalty-report-2018-press-release/\n\n\nwhitepaper | Why Today\u2019s Brands Need Fanatics Not Loyalists 4\n\nBut it is important to differentiate between loyalists, advocates, and fanatics as loyalty \nand advocacy are often used interchangeably with fanaticism (and with each other). In \nfact, there are very distinct differences between the actions and mindsets of individuals \nengaging with a brand at each stage of the customer journey.\n\nLoyalist (Customer+)\nLoyalty and advocacy are synergistic, but not interchangeable terms. Once a customer is\nretained and repeat business received, loyalty can be achieved over time\u2014but not every\nloyal customer will become an advocate.\n\nOften companies divert attention, investment, and effort back to new sales generation\nonce a person has been converted to a loyal repeat customer\u2013especially if that customer\nhas liked, followed, and shared.\n\nAdvocate (Loyalist+)\nThe primary difference between an advocate and a loyalist is action on behalf of a brand. \nWhile loyalty is demonstrated by reoccurring transactions, advocacy is equivocal to word-\nof-mouth recommendations, sharing, and even casual defense of a brand if necessary.\n\nFanatic (Advocate+)\nWhatever is true of an advocate is amplified with a fanatic.\n\nA fanatic\u2019s recommendation goes beyond a casual, \u201cYou should try,\u201d to enthusiastic\ninsistence that friends and family take action. Sharing becomes an interpersonal\nexchange whenever the opportunity presents itself. And advocac is no longer limited to\nposting good reviews, but also adamant defense against any disparaging words or actions\n\u2014all while continuing to purchase, like, follow, and share.\n\nRealistically, companies should expect customers to oscillate between loyalty and advocacy,\nbut once fanaticism is achieved these individuals become virtually lifelong ambassadors\nunless poor experiences or treatment change the customers paradigm. And that represents \nthe crux of achieving Fanaticism 2.0\u2014moving customers beyond a transactional and \ntemporary mindset to one that is emotional and driven by a sense of belonging.\n\nLOYALTY + ADVOCACY X PASSION = FANATICISM \n\n\n\nwhitepaper | Why Today\u2019s Brands Need Fanatics Not Loyalists 5\n\nUpgrade your customer funnel seamlessly with the latest technology \n\nThe traditional customer funnel was created to help ensure that companies acquired,\nretained, and grew customers as efficiently and profitably as possible. But today, a\nconsumer expects the brands she loves to not only make recommendations based on\nretrospective insights, but to proactively anticipate her wants and needs. Ad blocking and\nblindness are the ramifications of impersonal (and therefore irrelevant) advertising in a\nmarketplace where consumers are no longer forced to endure it.\n\nIt makes no fiscal sense to increase spending volume to \u201crise above\u201d the noise. A better \ninvestment is in optimized data management, cloud migration, and AI-driven technologies \nwhich are the keys to personalization\u2014the prerequisite for Fanaticism 2.0. Google, \nAmazon, and Netflix are great examples of brands that do just this. At SoftServe we advise \nour clients and provide solutions including, but not limited to:\n\nData optimization\nData is the lifeblood of genuine personalization. It must be consolidated, quality assured, \nand managed properly to ensure optimal results with artificial intelligence, machine \nlearning, natural language processing and more. \n\n\u2022 You don\u2019t become the number one search engine and advertising platform like Google \nwithout perpetually optimized data that drives relevant results for the individual.\n\nCloud migration\nMigration delivers agility for real time data processing and communications and is a\nmust for futureproof preparedness with technological advancements, as well as\nevolving consumer demands.\n\n\u2022 Netflix uses more than 37% of the Internet during peak hours. Let that sink in a \nmoment while you consider if that much personalized content streaming would be \npossible without the agility of the cloud.\n\nArtificial intelligence\nThere are too many touchpoints and data sources to ensure a genuinely personalized \nexperience with every engagement. Artificial intelligence drives machine learning that \nallows for automation, natural language technologies for voice, and smart environments \nthat allow for real time monitoring and response. \n\n\u2022 It wouldn\u2019t be possible to deliver personalized service as the largest store in the world \nwithout artificial intelligence. Just ask Amazon.\n\nThese are the same innovations required for both new business and fan building. With the\nproper foundations and strategies, futureproof technology will upgrade funnels and evolve\nin step with the marketplace\u2014and the individual consumers driving it.\n\nhttps://variety.com/2015/digital/news/netflix-bandwidth-usage-internet-traffic-1201507187/\n\n\nwhitepaper | Why Today\u2019s Brands Need Fanatics Not Loyalists 6\n\nConclusion\n\nEarning brand champions in today\u2019s marketplace essentially comes down to active listening,\nattentive response, and sustained relationship building. Accomplishing this can no longer be\neffectively done in traditional ways.

Valuable financial records are a prime target for those with bad intentions, and \nbreaches not only affect individual customers but cause significant brand damage.\n\nAs the financial services industry evolves to include better\u2014and more innovative\u2014\ntechnology, measures must be taken to keep data sealed tight, and within regulatory \ncompliance.  \n\nGive consumers what they want\u2014but take care\n\nToday\u2019s financial customers demand convenient, fast, and personalized digital experiences. \nThe ability to have on-demand access to all financial parameters at the tap of an app is no \nlonger a nice to have, it is essential. \n\nBut for an industry notorious for legacy systems, meeting those needs can be a challenge. \nFortunately, there are many paths for financial services businesses to update systems and \nreach customers\u2014securely. To that end, two clear paths have emerged: cloud migration \nand distributed ledger technology (DLT). \n\nMigrating to the cloud augments storage space while reducing power consumption and \ncosts, allowing companies to scale up and deliver more quickly. For financial services \nspecifically, this means a faster turnaround for service areas such as credit scoring, \nstatements, consumer payments, and billing.  \n\nDLT has also taken the industry by storm, offering a faster, more transparent way of doing \nbusiness. By its own structure\u2014which stacks data block-by-block\u2014security is intrinsic \nwithin the structure of the code, making transactions and contracts secure by nature.\n\nUnfortunately, there is an inherent misperception of security in both technologies: that \nfull security is \u201cbuilt in.\u201d This could not be further from the truth. For companies looking \nto leverage either technology, or any new technology for that matter, in-depth scrutiny is \nrequired before implementation. Let\u2019s dive deeper into common misconceptions\u2014and \nwhat to do about them\u2014in cloud migration and DLT. \n\nCloud migration\n\nWithin cloud migration, scalability and performance often take the spotlight over security. \nAnd assumptions about the nature of cloud security itself can lead to vulnerabilities.\n\nFor many financial businesses, one of the attractive features of the cloud (beyond the \npossibilities for saving costs and increasing agility) is the level of built-in security. But this is \noften a misreading of the cloud\u2019s shared responsibility model. \n\nCloud security and liability on the part of the cloud provider is limited. To clear any doubt, \nlet us be clear: turnkey security does not mean a risk-free cloud. In fact, there is a \nshared responsibility between both the cloud customer and the cloud provider.\n\n\n\nwhitepaper | It\u2019s Time to (Securely) Innovate Financial Services 3\n\nThe shared responsibility model means that while the cloud provider is responsible for \nthe security of the cloud, the customer is responsible for security in the cloud. Essentially \nthe cloud provider is responsible for the security of the cloud infrastructure, and for \nthe security of foundational services such as compute, storage, database, and network. \nThe cloud customer, meanwhile, has a long list of his own security responsibilities, such \nas client and server encryption, network traffic protection; OS, network, and firewall \nconfiguration; platform, application, identity, and access management; and\u2014of course\u2014\ncustomer data.\n\nAll solutions, data, and applications that exist within the cloud need their own, customized \nsecurity on the part of the cloud customer (i.e. the business).\n\nAnother problem is using legacy security solutions that simply don\u2019t belong anywhere in \nthe cloud. It isn\u2019t unusual for a cloud migration to be a direct shift of existing legacy systems \nfrom one location to another. But while the increased agility of the cloud increases market \nshare and volume, using outdated security systems to guard them is often inadequate. \nSecurity should therefore be updated to match the technology or platform upon which the \nsolution is placed.\n\nAs for those who are doubting the importance of security (if there are any doubters \nleft in our readership): corporate managers need not look deep into press archives to \nidentify recent security breaches\u2014action must be taken to regularly assess the health \nand security of your system to ensure that vulnerabilities are mitigated. Security \nis something that needs to be monitored around the clock, as well as regular security \nassessments and health checks that test vulnerabilities within the system and improve or \nupgrade it as needed.\n\nCustomer\nResponsibility\n\nCustomer Data\n\nCloud Foundation Services\n\nCloud Global Infrastructure\n\nClient Side Data Encryption& \nData Integrity Authentication\n\nNetwork Traffic Protection \n(Encryption/Integrity/Indentity)\n\nPlatform, Applications, Identity & Access Management\n\nOperating System, Network & Firewall Configuration\n\nSecurity  \n'in' the Cloud\n\nSecurity  \n'of' the Cloud\n\nCloud Provider\nResponsibility\n\nServer Side Encryption (File \nSystem and/or Data)\n\nCompute Storage Database Network\n\nRegions Availability Zones Edge Locations\n\n\n\nwhitepaper | It\u2019s Time to (Securely) Innovate Financial Services 4\n\nLet\u2019s get distributed\n\nDLT enables direct transactions, increases speed and transparency, and reduces fraud. But \nfor financial leaders, introducing DLT into the ecosystem means new and potentially more \ncomplex security risks.\n\nWhile most consider DLT to be airtight, the security of its application is entirely reliant on \nthose within the network. Increased transparency means transparency for all kinds of \ndifferent players, and not all with the best intentions. On the edge, there is significant room \nfor fraud to damage an otherwise secure solution.\n\nIn early 2018, Japanese cryptocurrency exchange Coincheck lost $530 million in a \ncryptocurrency theft. The source of the attack? Hackers gained access to the internet-\nconnected repository where users store cryptocurrencies (the \u201chot wallet\u201d). While the \ntechnology stayed intact, access to it was compromised. \n\nIn order to maintain the most secure posture, all members within a DLT network must be \nconstantly aware of the vulnerabilities that exist in its application, and how to avoid them.\n\nPutting your money where your mouth is\n\nThe financial services industry\u2019s aging, legacy software and IT solutions are difficult to \ndefend against modern cyberattacks. Running security as an add-on is risky\u2014tools that \ndon\u2019t integrate seamlessly need greater scrutiny than a system that has comprehensive, \ncustom security built into its foundation. Often, legacy systems don\u2019t scale to include \nprotection against modern security risks.\n\n\n\nwhitepaper | It\u2019s Time to (Securely) Innovate Financial Services 5\n\nThe best way to keep data secure is by weaving security into a solution from the beginning. \nIntegrating security with all other components of the solution architecture ensures \nseamlessness, making upgrades simpler and augmenting protection. \n\nBut at what point is built-in security in need of patches or upgrades? And how much \nadditional security is needed for a solution that incorporates legacy systems?\n\nThere are several things to keep in mind when building new solutions for financial services. \nLet\u2019s walk through the top considerations:\n\nRisk Assessment \nThe first step in assessing security compliance and posture is to assess risk. What are the \nmajor security risks and how can they best be addressed in order of priority?\n\nFinancial institutions should take inventory of all components within the system and assign \nvalue and risk. Customer data, back-end infrastructure, new solutions\u2014how is each valued \nwithin the larger structure, and what is its vulnerability? By assigning value and assessing \nrisk, financial leaders can then create a more substantial architecture.\n\nAssessing Architecture \nOnce the value and the risk are clear, the next secure step is to build an architecture to \nprotect data. Applying knowledge gained from the risk assessment, a firm architecture is \nthen assessed and tested, made scalable, and implemented. \n\nArchitecture assessments should extend throughout the infrastructure, as well\u2014from \nsolutions to applications. It\u2019s not uncommon to overlook security measures by accident, but \narchitecture must be a consideration for everything from back-end solutions to customer-\nfacing apps. Failing to consider comprehensive security will leave solutions vulnerable to \nattack.\n\nMonitoring \nWhat is the maintenance plan? After assessing risk and building a comprehensive \narchitecture, the most important step in keeping data secure is ongoing monitoring. \n\nWith the evolution of attacks happening every day, security teams must constantly check for \nvulnerabilities within any infrastructure, solution, or application. \n\n\n\nwhitepaper | It\u2019s Time to (Securely) Innovate Financial Services 6\n\nConclusion\n\nSecurity today is a constant, tireless reality for virtually any company. Financial businesses \nthat defer investments in infrastructure and technology solutions to protect customer and \nproprietary data risk losing customers and becoming tomorrow\u2019s news headline.\n\nAs financial businesses implement more innovative solutions into legacy systems\u2014and \nexperiment with hot technology\u2014the higher the risk is that data will be compromised. \nWhether cloud migration, DLT, or any number of recent innovations that are revolutionizing \nfinancial services, concrete steps proper steps should be taken to ensure security is airtight.\n\nAssess risk, build a strong architecture, and continuously monitor your systems to \nremain secure. \n\nAre you ready to take your infrastructure and technology solutions to the next level?  \nContact SoftServe to get started today.\n\n\n\nABOUT US\nSoftServe is a digital authority that advises and provides at the cutting-\nedge of technology.

Their mission  \nis to connect people through finance \nsharing, helping entrepreneurs find  \neasier access to more sources of funding  \nand satisfying investors with higher  \nreturns on their asset allocations.\n\nPartnering with SoftServe, our client\u2019s goal \nwas to build world\u2019s first invoice exchange \nplatform leveraging blockchain technology. \n\nBusiness Challenge\n\nThere are several challenges associated \nwith creating a marketplace exchange to \n\nbuy and sell invoices. The majority  \nof the financial assets, including invoices \nwhen traded in classic trading exchanges  \nor marketplaces, cannot be sold right  \nafter they are bought by the investor.  \nThe investor has to keep the asset until  \nthe day of maturity. These can only  \nbe traded in fiat currency.\n\nThe client wanted to redefine the invoice \nfinancing practice by introducing  \nthe exchange that enables both parties \nto actively trade (buy and re-sell) assets \npurchased at initial marketplaces  \nwith no timing restrictions.\n\nThis solution aimed not to compete  \nwith banks and alternative financial bodies,  \nlike P2P lenders, but instead planned  \nto treat these groups as customers.\n\n\n\ncase study |    Building a Blockchain-Based Exchange Platform for Invoice Trading 2\n\nProject Description\n\nInitially, the client created the marketplace \nwhere business owners could optimize working \ncapital by placing their invoices up for auction, \nwhere investors can bid for them. Investors \ncould allocate their free resources by \u2018buying\u2019 \nthe part or the whole invoice amount (or other \nasset) placed at the market. The marketplace \nwas created to provide easy access to capital \nfor small and middle business and give \ninvestors another instrument to manage their \nfree resources directly.\n\nThe client wanted to make this process even \nmore secure, transparent and easy to use for \nall parties involved; and to speed the turnover \nof the capital by enabling reselling of the assets \nbefore their maturity date. The blockchain \ntechnology was chosen to support these \nrequirements when building a new solution.\n\nThe client partnered with SoftServe to develop \nthe first-to-be exchange for invoices based  \non blockchain.\n\nTheir solution optimizes the use of DLT \n(Distributed Ledger Technology) within  \nthe blockchain to augment invoice trading and \nprovide anyone with the opportunity  \nto easily trade invoices or other assets  \non the blockchain. \n\nThe developed platform behaves like a stock \nexchange, where investors from all walks of life \ncan trade any crypto assets such as an invoice, \ninventory, trade contracts, shares, etc.  \nThe exchange employs the tokenization \nsystem, and only tokens with strong tangible \nback up from the real economy can be traded \n(i.e. trade receivables, inventory, business loans \nand other tradeable assets). \n\nThe investor can buy the whole asset  \nor invest only in a part of it. This is called  \na crowdfunding approach for an invoice.  \nIt increases the utilization of the free capital \navailable at the exchange and the quantity  \nof satisfied requests for the investment  \nfrom the businesses. The exchange trade \nreceivables agreements (ETRA) authorize  \nthe trade interaction between investors \n(invested in the invoice) and businesses  \n(who placed them in the exchange) by stating  \nthe ownership of the asset. The agreement  \nis an example of the asset that will be tokenized \nto be traded in the platform and the agreement \ncirculates in the exchange until it is finally  \npaid by the buyer. \n\nThe platform architecture is based on a smart \ncontract and provides full transparency  \nof events along with supply chain.  \nIt increases process efficiency, reduces risk  \nof fraud and dramatically lowers costs.\n\n\n\ncase study |    Building a Blockchain-Based Exchange Platform for Invoice Trading 3\n\nBitcoin\nlenders LSX P2P lenders\n\nInvoice\nmarketplaces\n\nTokenized asset\n\nAsset\n\nValue Delivered\n\nAs this solution was built from scratch, \nSoftServe worked closely with the client \nto identify their business needs, define \nan approach to platform implementation, \nand conduct a security assessment for \nthe architecture and smart contracts \nimplemented in the platform.\n\nSoftServe, as a partner, was responsible \nfor developing the innovative solution that \nyields numerous benefits for all involved \nparties, including:\n\n\u2022 Providing easy access to extra  \nliquidity - parties such as P2P lenders, \ncrowd funders, and recently emerging \ncrypto funding players can all benefit \nfrom the liquidity offered by the platform.\n\n\u2022 Interaction acceleration - the marketplace \nacts as accelerator that will stimulate \ntrade, create interest among investors \nand help get invoices fully funded. \n\nInvestors can sell their invoices or other \nassets on the exchange rather than wait \nseveral days for the asset to mature.\n\n\u2022 Improving the world\u2019s trading \ninfrastructure \u2013 invoices bought from \nalternative finance marketplaces around \nthe world are traded on the platform.\n\n\u2022 Built in blockchain technology guarantees \nfast settlement speed, asset tokenization, \ntransparent rules of trade and provides  \nan asset management infrastructure  \nto all ecosystem participants. This also \nallows collective management use cases, \nreduces trade costs, improves the overall \ntrading infrastructure, and guarantees \nsecurity against unauthorized history  \nor account changes.\n\n\u2022 Openness and engagement  \nfor all types of investors \u2013 trading  \nin any fiat and cryptocurrency,  \nincluding Bitcoins and Ethers is allowed.\n\nThe smart contract design follows a modular \ncontract structure making it highly reusable \nand easy to upgrade.  \n\nTransaction metadata is available only  \nfor entities that are authorized to access it.\n\n\n\nNORTH AMERICAN HQ\n\n201 W 5th Street, Suite 1550\nAustin, TX 75703\n+1 866 687 3588 \n\n1 University Avenue Suite 11-112\nToronto, ON M5J 2P1\n+1 647 948 7638\n\nEUROPEAN HQ\n\n14 New Street \nLondon EC2M 4HE \n+44 (0) 800 302 9436\n\ninfo@softserveinc.com\nwww.softserveinc.com\n\nABOUT US\nSoftServe is a digital authority that advises and provides at the \ncutting-edge of technology.

And this queen is the fashionable media darling \ngarnering worldwide attention. \n\nWhen Bill Gates said \u201cContent is King\u201d in January of 1996, he envisioned \nthe business model for the internet to be similar to that of broadcasting. \nHowever, technology advances have disrupted traditional broadcast with \ninnovations like OTT (over-the-top content), time-shifted media, and the \nability to bypass traditional monetization archetypes, leaving broadcasters \nscrambling to create new business models. Content is king when all \nmethods of consumption are equal, but in today\u2019s hyper-connected world, \ncontent is being consumed by an ever-increasing array of methods and \ndevices that are anything but equal. \n\n\u0421ontent is where I expect much of the real money will be \n\nmade on the Internet, just as it was in broadcasting.\n\nThere\u2019s no arguing that consumers are seeking quality content. People are \neagerly willing to pay for content that aligns with their tastes, reflects their \nlifestyles, or helps them achieve their professional and personal objectives. \nBut most of today\u2019s content is highly portable and available in multiple \nlocations across an array of platforms. With essentially the same content \navailable in a myriad of locations, it\u2019s the platform experience that is driving \nmuch of the revenue. True, without the content the platform\u2019s value is \nworthless. But what leads a person to subscribe or consume content on \none platform versus another? The experience. \n\nhttps://www.craigbailey.net/content-is-king-by-bill-gates/\n\n\nwhitepaper\n\nTRANSFORMING MEDIA EXPERIENCES WITH MODERN PLATFORMS 3\n\nThe Experience is the Platform\n\nThrough various media platforms and super platforms (think Amazon, \nApple, Facebook, Google) today\u2019s content is portable across devices, screen \nsizes, online and offline, and operating systems. Whether it\u2019s watching, \nlistening, reading, interacting, playing, or competing; how the content \ngets consumed is largely related to how well the platform experience is \ndesigned and tailored towards the needs of the user. \n\nLet\u2019s take Spotify for example. In addition to having a great library of \ncontent and a slick user interface, Spotify is doing something even more \namazing to deliver an incredible media experience. Spotify\u2019s \u201cDiscover \nWeekly\u201d feature creates a personalized playlist for each user every Monday \nbased on their listening habits. A recent Adweek article described Spotify\u2019s \nusers as not just fans of Discover Weekly, but \u201caddicts.\u201d That\u2019s a fact that \nonly became clear to the company when it recently suffered a service \noutage due to the high demand. \n\nIn the Adweek article, a Spotify product owner is quoted as saying, \u201cThe \nfeature\u2019s success has completely changed how the Swedish company \nthinks about experiences for its more than 100 million users.\u201d And based \non the success of Discover Weekly, Spotify is looking to invest more heavily \ninto algorithm-based playlists.\n\nImage source: Spotify\n\nhttp://www.adweek.com/digital/even-spotify-surprised-huge-success-its-discover-weekly-playlists-173129/\n\n\nwhitepaper\n\nTRANSFORMING MEDIA EXPERIENCES WITH MODERN PLATFORMS 4\n\nContent creators are no longer relying on just one single platform as their \nmedia outlet, but rather ensuring maximum audience exposure through \ndistribution agreements with many different platforms and providers. \nThe same content, independent of its value or quality, is now available \neverywhere. The portability of the content has created a scenario where it\u2019s \nthe ability to provide a variety of content from multiple different creators \nand publishers - as well as how that content is served up and experienced by \ncustomers - that drives user engagement on one platform versus another. \n\nThe old broadcast model of content distribution was a very passive linear \nmodel. Now that model has been turned on its head and requires varying \ncontent to be served up on-demand based on tastes and behaviors. Audiences \nlook for experiences where they can consume a range of content curated to \ntheir liking when and where they want it. \n\n\n\nwhitepaper\n\nTRANSFORMING MEDIA EXPERIENCES WITH MODERN PLATFORMS 5\n\nDisruptive Factors \nfor Content Consumption \nDigital leaders and industry disruptors like Spotify have leveraged \nexperience design and technology innovation to create transformational \ndigital experiences for their customers. Content creators and providers \ncan apply these same elements and characteristics to their distribution \nplatforms to create unique experiences that transcend the content and set \nthemselves apart from competitors. \n\nExceptional digital experiences can generally be broken down into the \nfollowing critical elements: personalized, convenient, real-time, socially \nconnected, and valuable beyond the transaction. The following are \nrecommendations on how these elements can be applied to content: \n\nPersonalize the Experience for the Individual User\n\nKnow who is using the platform at any given moment and tailor the \ncontent to the individual user\u2019s tastes. Learn from their choices and \nbehaviors to suggest similar content they would likely enjoy. \n\nBe Convenient (Digitally Speaking) \n\nUnderstand that we\u2019re now a mobile society with consumers who are \npassionate about our content and experiences. We want our content to \nbe available wherever we happen to be at the time. Convenient options \nlike content that is available both offline and online are game-changing \ndifferentiators. \n\nConnect Socially with Your Audience\n\nPeople love to share and discuss great content so ensure they have the \nability to do so right from the platform itself. Subsequently, when users \nare not on your platform, make certain they\u2019re getting updates about \nnew content from their social feeds. Social platforms such as Snapchat, \nInstagram, and Facebook are especially good for providing off-platform \ncontent updates promos and teasers. \n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n\n\nwhitepaper\n\nTRANSFORMING MEDIA EXPERIENCES WITH MODERN PLATFORMS 6\n\nConnect in Real-Time\n\nIn addition to ensuring your content is timely and relevant, it\u2019s likely you \nhave access to a whole host of real-time data that can be used to enhance \nyour customer\u2019s experience. Considering the customer\u2019s context is equally \nas important. What device are they\u2019re currently using? Are they in motion? \nWalking or driving? What time of day is it? Answering these questions can \nhelp you serve up an experience that is tailored to real-time factors.  \n\nProvide Ongoing Value, Not Transactional Value\n\nEnsure the platform is a true go-to destination. Delivering value may \nmean a personalized experience, but it could also be features like \nproviding updates on new releases, events, appearances, signings, \nsupplementary content, recommendations, and - most importantly - the \nfeeling of a community.  \n\nChoose the Right Platform to Deliver the Right Experience\n\nOne thing content creators and publishers need to keep in mind is that \nnot all platforms are designed to deliver exceptional experiences for all \ntypes of content. Gaming platforms are obviously ideal for video games, \nbut they are also well-suited to deliver a great streaming audio and video \nexperience. However, they tend to be limited to being able to deliver \nthis experience only on their hardware and do not cross over easily to \nseamless web and mobile experiences. \n\nSimilarly, content types that require complex interactions are not well \nsuited for platforms that have limited input control, such as a simple \nremote. Attempting to consume content on a platform not built to deliver \nthe expected experience can lead to a negative impression \u2013 not only for \nthe platform, but for the content as well. \n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n\n\nwhitepaper\n\nTRANSFORMING MEDIA EXPERIENCES WITH MODERN PLATFORMS 7\n\nSimply put, the experience around how content is consumed heavily \ninfluences the content\u2019s worth to the consumer. In other words, great \nexperiences increase the content\u2019s perceived value, while a negative \nexperience can rapidly diminish it. Though the content remains the same, \nconsumers are quick to judge its value by their experience around its \nconsumption. To bring my point full circle, if content is king, the experience \nsurrounding that content is queen - and the platform that delivers \nthat content has a significant impact on the user\u2019s perception of that \nexperience. Great content on its own is no longer enough. \n\nThe current strategy for content providers is to either build their own \nplatforms, leverage an existing industry solution, or a combination of both, \nand this trend varies greatly by content types as well as consumer types. \nBut no matter what strategy is taken, the consumption of the experience \nneeds to be a key component of the equation. \n\n\n\nwhitepaper\n\nTRANSFORMING MEDIA EXPERIENCES WITH MODERN PLATFORMS 8\n\nAbout the Author\n\nMatt Kollmorgen is a digital strategist with a focus in enterprise \ntechnology.

Here are 5 steps for remaining proactive in a \nmodern era of digital transformation:\n\n1.  Embrace the trend to evolve into a technology \ncompany, even if that\u2019s not your heritage.\n\nLeaders across multiple industries have made a shift to develop digital \nproduct offerings for their customers, even when digital products are not \ntheir core competency. This transformation to embrace both digital and \ntraditional products within their portfolio not only increases customer loyalty \nand satisfaction, but also the ability to deliver experiences long term on a \nmultitude of different platforms. For example:\n\n \ufffd The Nike+ product consolidates retail, fitness, and customer service \nprocesses into one single customer experience. Expanding beyond \ntheir apparel products, Nike launched an open-source software \ntool to optimize the customer\u2019s ownership and satisfaction of Nike \nproducts. Beyond just being a product, Nike+ is a premium athletic \ntraining experience. \n\n\n\nwhite paper\n\n5 STEPS TO COMBAT DIGITAL DISRUPTION IN THE MODERN ERA 3\n\n \ufffdWal-Mart has also been an undercover technology company for \nsometime, developing three iPhone applications and maintaining an \nopen product catalog API. \n\n \ufffd  Tesco, a British multinational grocery and general merchandise \nretailer, has created a subsidiary worth $1 billion dollars to monetize \nthe data gathered from its customers by allowing packaged goods \ncompanies to access it. \n\n2.  Look for ways to defeat or disrupt your own business.\n\nOften the most progressive changes come when we look at our own internal \nstructures. There may be hurdles you encounter, or you may find that you \nare already equipped to elevate your organization to handle new objectives. \nGather key stakeholders within your executive team or digital task force and \nreview the following areas to determine if you are ready to disrupt or if your \nbusiness is vulnerable to disruption:\n\n \ufffd Current employee skill set: Do you have the adequate skill set in-\nhouse to develop the user experience, products, or service that will set \nyou apart from others in your industry? Conduct an inventory of your \nemployee skill sets and identify where you are lacking the expertise to \nbring your digital vision to life. If you find you don\u2019t have the skill sets \nneeded, consider bringing in a third-party with validated strengths to \naccelerate your product to the marketplace.\n\n \ufffd \tNew\tdigital\tstaffing: If your organization has been successful in more \ntraditional business models, you may have never needed employees with \nvalidated digital skills with backgrounds in commerce platforms, Big Data \nanalytics, social media, and the Internet of Things (IoT). These skills require \na different business acumen and background than other conventional \nstaffing models that have fueled business growth in the past.\n\n \ufffd  \u201cData First\u201d decisions: Making strategic decisions for the business in \nthe past used to be made with general consumer personas informed by \nresearch that varied widely in age. With the advancement of Big Data \nanalytics and user data now available in real-time, organizations can \n\n\n\nwhite paper\n\n5 STEPS TO COMBAT DIGITAL DISRUPTION IN THE MODERN ERA 4\n\nmake instantaneous decisions about what products go on the shelf, \nwhat services should replace others, and what user experiences should \nbe offered on what day based on the data that is available and adjust \nthem as necessary to continuously delight the end user. \n\n3.  Remember the \u201c3 R\u2019s\u201d: Revise, Refresh, Reform.\n\nAt the core of this discussion, there are three basic fundamental areas which \nrequire attention and care to stay ahead of a digital disruption. But it\u2019s simple \nto do so by just remembering the 3 R\u2019s as they relate to your business: revise, \nrefresh and reform. It\u2019s a continuous cycle that must be maintained, not \nsimply \u201cone and done,\u201d as digital disruption is always looming behind you \nand you must stay one step ahead. \n\n \ufffd Revise your cost structure: This isn\u2019t limited only to your pricing \nstructure, but every expenditure within your business: your people, your \nsupply chain, and overhead costs. Control costs to compete with other \ndigitally powered, low-cost new competitors.\n\n \ufffd  Refresh revenue streams: It\u2019s critical to build new sources of revenue \nacross all segments of the business, geographies, and business models. \nMany organizations have found that legacy streams of revenue have \ndried up in the wake of digital disruption. \n\n \ufffd  Reform corporate strategies: Being nimble and agile in the age \nof digital disruption has never been more important. All digital \nstakeholders will have to consider assets, risk, and corporate agility in \norder to position the organization for long-term success in the digital \nmarketplace. \n\n4.  Determine what type of disruptive business model you \nwant to be.\n\nCompanies find themselves desperate to become the next Uber, AirBnB, or \nAmazon, or otherwise scrambling to solve for how to handle the disruption \ncaused by these hyper-disruptive business models.\n\n\n\nwhite paper\n\n5 STEPS TO COMBAT DIGITAL DISRUPTION IN THE MODERN ERA 5\n\nBut hyper-disruptive businesses models are evolving constantly just like the \nbusinesses themselves. Let\u2019s examine some of the most popular business \nmodels1, the types of businesses that have made them notable, and what \nyou need to have in order to remain competitive in this model. \n\n \ufffd The Subscription Model (Netflix, Dollar Shave Club, StitchFix): Disrupts \nthrough \u201clock-in\u201d by taking a product or service that is traditionally \npurchased on an ad hoc basis, and creating a repeat customer by \ncharging a subscription fee for continued access to the product/service. \nBeyond consistent revenue, it also satisfies the \u201cneed it now\u201d user \nexperience and eliminating the necessity for customers to shop in a \nbrick-and-mortar store for products. \n\n \ufffd The Marketplace Model (eBay, iTunes, Uber, AirBnB): Disrupts with \nthe provision of a digital marketplace that brings together buyers \nand sellers directly, in return for a transaction, placement fee, or \ncommission. This model extends the options and experiences that \ncustomers have beyond traditional models, for example in retail stores, \nrental cars, and hotels. \n\n \ufffd  The Access-over-Ownership Model (Zipcar, Peerbuy, AirBnB): Disrupts \nby providing temporary access to goods and services traditionally only \navailable through purchase. Includes \u201cSharing Economy\u201d disruptors, \nwhich take a commission from people monetizing their assets (home, \ncar, capital) by lending them to borrowers. The Access-over-Ownership \nmodel extends capabilities to customers who otherwise would not have \noptions, for example, the ability to drive a car without ownership or the \nability to earn additional income on their property without long-term \ncommitments. \n\n \ufffd  The Pyramid Model (Amazon, Microsoft, Rodan + Fields): Disrupts \nby recruiting an army of resellers and affiliates who are often paid \non a commission-only model. Historically, pyramid models had a bad \nreputation within retail, but they have had a rebirth in the modern era. \nTechnology companies use them to put their products in the hands \n\n1.

Other retailers are \nnow utilizing social media models to promote their products through \nassociates while also maintaining a lower price point rather than having \na brick-and-mortar. \n\n \ufffd The Experience Model (Tesla, Apple, JetBlue): Disrupts by providing \na superior experience, for which people are prepared to pay \u2014 \nhandsomely. The Experience Model demonstrates a shift in thinking: \nlower cost is not always king when an improved customer experience \naccompanies the product, especially when the product is something \nthat is high-value or frequently used. \n\n5.  Don\u2019t entirely abandon your core business \noperating model.\n\nYou have achieved success as a business due to the products, services, \nor experiences that you have offered to-date. The key to surviving digital \ndisruption is not to entirely annihilate the way you have done business \npreviously, but to enhance it with other offerings that meet the needs of your \ncustomers both from how they use your product and how humans consume \nproducts and services. You know your product best. Now it is up to you and \nyour digital stakeholders to evolve how people can consume it better in their \neveryday lives. \n\nThe choice to disrupt or be disrupted is in your hands. It requires constant \nforesight and examination of your business processes, products, and \ncustomer experiences as well as careful evaluation of newcomers appearing \nin the marketplace to ensure you remain competitive. Innovation doesn\u2019t \nhappen overnight, but disruption does. \n\nBy staying agile with these 5 steps, you\u2019ll enable your business of today to \nevolve into a business of tomorrow. \n\n\n\nAbout SoftServe\n\nWith over 20 years of experience in digital software development and \nconsulting, SoftServe is a global leader in solving complex business \nproblems, creating industry disrupting technology and accelerating growth \nand innovation while optimizing operational efficiency.

Their application processes \nand aggregates online eCommerce websites and provides the users with \nthe ability to browse online catalogs through unified and mobile optimized \nuser interface while staying completely anonymous. The application \nallows users to tag items to create visual bookmarks and organize their \nbrowsing, as well as offering recommendations based on the users\u2019 tags \nand shopping history.\n\n\n\nBusiness Challenge\n\nThe app provides end users with considerable benefits but the initial monetization modes \nwere limited to selling premium accounts with higher (compared to free app) monthly page \nviews limits. To introduce a new revenue stream and provide additional benefits to customers \nthe client decided to implement in-store messaging functionality with offers and promotions as \nwell as customer loyalty program based on customer recurring visits to stores that participate \nin the program. The company chose SoftServe as the main technology partner to implement \nthis solution.\n\nProject Description\n\nThe team decided to use state of the art proximity sensors - known as iBeacons \u2013 to \nhelp retailers attract and reward repeat visitors. Shoppers who have the free Mobile App \nearn rewards just for visiting and returning to their favorite local stores and restaurants. \nAdditionally, when the shoppers pass near the store participating in the program they receive \ncontext and location based notifications with offers and promotions from the store.\n\niBeacon is a technology that enables the usage of a new class of low-powered and low-cost \ntransmitters that can notify nearby mobile devices of their presence.The technology enables a \nsmartphone or other device to perform actions when in close proximity to an iBeacon. iBeacon \nuses Bluetooth low energy proximity sensing to transmit a universally unique identifier picked \nup by a compatible app or operating system. The identifier can then be looked up over the \ninternet to determine the device\u2019s physical location or trigger an action on the device such as \na check-in on social media or a push notification. Various vendors produce hardware iBeacons \nin a variety of form factors, including small coin cell devices, USB sticks, and generic Bluetooth \n4.0 capable USB dongles. In contrast to GPS, iBeacon devices work indoors providing unique \npossibilities for their usage.\n\nSoftServe developed the In-Store Messaging and Loyalty Program solution with the following \nmain components:\n\n \u2022 iBeacon devices installed in stores and configured using vendorsupplied mobile application\n \u2022 Back-end system covering:\n\n \u2022 iBeacon device registration and management\n \u2022 Dashboard for retailers to configure their location based notifications, promotions and \n\nloyalty programs\n \u2022 Improved mobile application capable of interacting with iBeacon devices and back-end \n\nsystems\n\nTo participate in the program retailers need to:\n\n1. Sign up, receive their iBeacon device, and plug this device in\n2. Use merchant dashboard web interface to set up their visitor reward levels and \n\nproportional notifications\n3. Invite customers to join the loyalty program\n\n2case study | E-commerce Aggregator Deploys In-Store, iBeacon Powered Loyalty Program\n\n\n\nTo join the loyalty program customers need to:\n\n1. Install the free application\n2. Visit a store that participates in the program. No additional check-in is required.\n3. Redeem their reward using mobile application\n\nValue Delivered\n\nAfter this solution was developed the application\u2019s monetization has become much easier and \nthe application became a leader in the market segment. In addition to charging end users for \npremium accounts, the client now has the possibility to secure deals with shops and shopping \ncenters. Recently the client signed a deal with a large shopping mall to launch joint promotions \nand loyalty program for all shops and restaurants in the mall.\n\nThe additional benefits of the solution include:\n\n \u2022 Retailers can create multiple rewards and communication\n \u2022 Easy and non obtrusive engagement for shoppers. All shoppers participate by visiting.

Whether addressing the customer by name, or making\nrecommendations based on purchase history, a personalized experience is a key step in\nearning customer loyalty. In fact, 76% of retailers intend to increase the volume of\npersonalized promotions and offers in 2018, according to RetailMeNot.\n\nCustomer data is crucial to delivering individually tailored promotions. In fact,\nit is at the heart of efficient and profitable businesses, across sales, operations,\ninventory, and logistics.\n\nData is driving the future of retail and is as good as currency. Knowing what data to use,\nand how and where to use it will determine success both online and in-store.\n\nThe data difference\n\nImagine a future where a store will recognize a shopper from the moment of arrival\nwhether in-store, online, or on a mobile device to deliver customized, end-to-end\nmemorable experiences worth sharing. A future driven by comprehensive, accurate data.\n\nToday's business leaders must make data a priority. Incomplete or faulty data can lead \nto missed opportunities, uninformed decision-making, non-compliance sanctions, \nand low customer satisfaction. But while many retail executives understand data can \nmake the difference, data quality continues to be a source of frustration. According to \nExperian, 69% of retailers state that data quality issues negatively impact customer \ntrust and perception.\n\nAll data can serve a purpose in the pursuit of optimizing shopper experiences, product\nportfolio and inventory, and building brand loyalty\u2014but not all data is created equal.\n\nWith limited time and resources, retailers need to consider the value of the data sourced\nand which methods of data collection to use. The three primary categories of data\nsources, in order from \u201cgood\u201d to \u201cbetter\u201d to \u201cbest,\u201d are: third-party data, second-party \ndata, and first-party data.\n\nhttps://www.invespcro.com/blog/online-shopping-personalization/\nhttps://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/retailmenot-releases-new-retail-marketing-trends-report-finding-marketers-are-bullish-moving-into-2018-300605374.html\nhttps://www.edq.com/contact-data-quality-statistics/\n\n\nwhitepaper | Data: The New Currency for Retail 3\n\nThird-party data and competitive advantage\n\nThird-party data is typically purchased to compensate for gaps or blind spots in data \nthat is generated from the business. The most widely used third-party datasets include \ndemographic, geographic, and psychographic information which are leveraged for behavioral \nand contextual marketing. Realized value varies depending on the ultimate business goal.\n\nWhen third-party data is acquired, it is often unclear how the data was collected, where it \nwas collected from, and how old the data is. This means third-party data generally needs \nto be \"scrubbed\" to ensure quality before it is incorporated into company programs.\n\nData harvesting and web scraping are established methods used by list vendors to \ngather personally identifiable information (PII). These techniques yield high volumes of \ndata which can be useful. However, traditional and non-consensual web scraping should \nbe avoided as these can violate data regulation standards and possibly create public \nrelations nightmares for brands.\n\nTo protect an individual\u2019s privacy, the EU\u2019s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) has \nput the onus on companies to comply with strict guidelines. This could be a precursor to \nsimilar legislation in the US, so the days of profiting from PII without express user consent \nare coming to an end.\n\nToday, the best practice is to work solely with third-party data vendors that engage \ncustomers directly, earn trust, and gain permission to leverage PII.\n\nExamples include:\n\n\u2022 Engaging with customers directly, ultimately gaining permission to leverage PII\n\u2022 Cross-referencing existing customers to reach similar prospects\n\u2022 Reaching new target audiences, demographically and geographically\n\u2022 Competing in new channels\n\nPros: Compensate for data gaps, high-level persona research, and alignment targeting \nCons: Lack of visibility on how data is collected and managed, requires in-house scrubbing \nbefore incorporating into company programs, and may contravene GDPR compliance\n\n\n\nwhitepaper | Data: The New Currency for Retail 4\n\nSecond-party data\u2014a reliable predictor of consumer intent\n\nPersonalized experiences are only as good as the visibility that drives them. Second-party\ndata\u2014high quality first-party data collected by an outside provider\u2014tracks what happens\nwhen a customer leaves a website, shops at another retailer, or shares new information\nwith someone else. Second-party data provides the opportunity for brands to collaborate\nand deliver the best engagements using a 360-degree view of consumers.\n\nRetailers that haven\u2019t already leveraged second-party data may be surprised to find that\nmajor brands are already trading in highly reputable marketplaces. The cost of second-\nparty data can vary widely depending on the quality and demand.\n\nSecond-party data is a reliable predictor of consumer intent, as it provides transparent\naccess to first-party data from competitive retailers, brands, and marketers. This\neliminates concerns on source, date of origin, and alignment with marketing.\n\nExamples include:\n\n\u2022 Entering a new market to reach a niche segment\n\u2022 Partnering with a complimentary business to cross-promote products\n\u2022 Selling data as a new revenue stream\n\nPros: Reliable, aligned, and extends self-generated insights\nCons: Additional marketing cost may be significant if first-party data is insufficient\n\nFirst-party data\n\nFirst-party data is owned by a company outright and is collected directly from consumers\nand internal systems. It is the most reliable data source, with virtually no concerns\nregarding collection methodology, data origination, or application.\n\nSources of first-party data include:\n\n\u2022 Website and mobile app usage\n\u2022 In-store interactions and purchases\n\u2022 Shopping cart purchases and\n\nabandonments\n\u2022 CRM activity\n\n\u2022 Social pages and blog interactions\n\u2022 CRM data (ideation sessions, client\n\ncalls, birthdays, etc.)\n\u2022 Subscriptions\n\u2022 Survey responses\n\n\n\nwhitepaper | Data: The New Currency for Retail 5\n\nExamples include:\n\n\u2022 Predicting future patterns, such as audience behavior\n\u2022 Gaining audience insights into customer traits, preferences, and behaviors\n\u2022 Personalizing content, promotions, and recommendations\n\nPros: High quality, comes straight from target audience, company owns and controls,\nno fee to use\nCons: Responsible for data management, security, and quality\n\nGenerating data is not a means to an end. The challenge for companies is to leverage \nthe right data to understand the consumer, inspire engagement, and to earn and keep \ncustomers' brand loyalty. If data doesn't do that\u2014whether it is first-, second-, or third-\nparty\u2014it is not worthy of inclusion.\n\nOvercoming data challenges\n\nBut what is worthy of inclusion? To guard against data waste, a retailer must first identify\ndata challenges, understand the technological options available, and then overcome\nexisting barriers by complementing with second- or third-party data.\n\nFor many retailers, the first challenge to leveraging customer data is internal. Often data is\ndisorganized and spread across disparate databases that don\u2019t communicate with one\nanother. These cluttered data silos arise when retailers do not fully comprehend the value \nof data, or aren\u2019t sure how to turn insight into action. Most retailers simply haven\u2019t devoted \nthe necessary budget or technology to maximize data assets.\n\n\n\nwhitepaper | Data: The New Currency for Retail 6\n\nUsing technology to improve customer experience\n\nAI-driven solutions, powered by data, empower retailers to tailor and personalize programs\nto each customer or customer group. Chatbots, voice assistants, voice search, and voice-\nenabled purchasing all help shoppers who prefer to be independent. Data can also power \naugmented and virtual reality technology, offering shoppers the chance to try on clothes\nor test how furniture would look in their homes\u2014all without leaving the showroom.\n\nAnd beyond providing shopper insights, these technologies can also improve efficiency.\n\nDelivering the smart store experience\n\nAt SoftServe, we help our clients analyze data beyond dashboards and automated\nreporting to ensure it is leveraged properly at the store, chain, and corporate levels.\nWhether it's data quality assessment and management, predictive analytics, infrastructure \nupgrades, platform optimization, or immersive experiences\u2014our experts can help.\n\nContact SoftServe today and learn how we\u2019ve enabled retail clients to harness data to\ndeliver tailored experiences for shoppers, ultimately improving efficiency and profitability.\n\nSecondly, communications between business development and IT are often limited. The\nformer is typically focused on building brand and making sales, while the latter is\nconcerned solely with keeping the machine running.\n\nThirdly, as retailers add new channels, core systems are being stretched beyond original\nintent. The problem becomes a red flag of its own making.\n\nSo how should retailers tackle these challenges? Patchwork updates are expensive and\nmay be outdated once integrated, and complete system overhauls are cost prohibitive.\n\nRather than taking drastic measures\u2014or worse, no measures at all\u2014retailers must\nbalance customer expectations with achievable goals. Retailers must identify what\ncustomers demand today and evaluate what the company can deliver. By identifying\nboth digital and in-store KPIs, an innovative plan can be developed.\n\nhttps://www.softserveinc.com/en-us/contact/\n\n\nABOUT US\nSoftServe is a global digital authority and consulting company, operating \nat the cutting edge of technology.

So why \nthe disconnect between brand intent and customer reality?\n\nToday\u2019s consumer is attention deficient. More than ever it\u2019s imperative that a message \ncaptures her attention in three seconds or less. To accomplish that while delivering a truly \npersonal experience a brand must know the individual, proactively anticipate her wants \nand needs, and then deliver on-demand service in real time.  That\u2019s personalization at \nscale. Companies must analyze and address this challenge differently while moving from \nlegacy processes and technology, to current and future leaning capabilities. \n\nUltimately, it\u2019s about thinking, planning, and preparing for the moments of truth when a \nconsumer decides if a marketing message is relevant. If not, there\u2019s no guarantee a brand \nwill get another chance.\n\nIn this white paper we\u2019ll look at how personalization has changed and why big data, artificial \nintelligence (AI), and machine learning (ML) should be driving Personalization 2.0 efforts.\n\nLooking back before moving forward\n\nIn the past personalization meant including a customer\u2019s name on mass-mailed form \nletters, each with the recipient\u2019s name inserted in the salutation. For its time, this \nmethodology was a positive step forward in marketing automation as indicated by the \nincreased response rates generated.\n\nSegmentation was a foundational tool for the mass marketing that was meant to \npersonalize by dividing the populace into demographically-, psychographically-, and \ngeographically-defined groups appearing to share commonalities. There was a time when \nthis was the most effective approach, but segmentation\u2019s efficacy has been perpetually \ndiminished by consumers who resist labels, define what a brand is or isn\u2019t, and dictate \nrelevance like never before.\n\n\n\nwhitepaper | Earn Fan Loyalty with Personalization 2.0 3\n\nDespite ongoing reliance on bulk mail and segmentation-centric marketing, the use of \npast tense is intentional as these techniques are remnants of the past, quickly losing \nviability as technology leaves them behind. Fortunately, wasted dollars due to inefficient \nengagement (related to impersonal experiences) is more preventable than ever thanks to \nevolving consumer understanding. Today\u2019s data sources provide unique insights into \nindividual consumers that eliminate the need to assume that one person within a segment \nlooks, thinks, and purchases like another. This ideal isn\u2019t revelatory, but reliance on legacy \nsegmentation and personalization persists, most often due to a lack of technical expertise, \ncapacity, or combination of both.\n\nWhat is Personalization 2.0?\n\nCoined by Forrester\u2019s Brendan Witcher, the term refers to the migration away from a \nsegmentation-driven strategy in favor of real-time preferences across multiple channels \nand devices. For example, consider an expectant mother\u2014as identified by her recent app, \nsocial, and shopping history. It is far more personal to deliver an in-the-moment mobile \noffer inside the store and in close proximity to a nursery item, than if that same offer was \nsent to all women who have made baby-related purchases within a designated marketing \narea\u2014regardless of location, expressed interest, or current activity. \n\nExamples of the Personalization 2.0 evolution include:\n\n\u201cIndividualization is the new North Star for personalization.\u201d \n(Forrester)\n\n\n\nwhitepaper | Earn Fan Loyalty with Personalization 2.0 4\n\n\u2022 Amazon sets the standard for proactive recommendations based on historical data\n\u2022 Starbucks gamified its mobile app offering loyalty rewards and custom ordering\n\u2022 Coca-Cola increased sales for the first time in over a decade with #shareacoke\n\u2022 Virgin Hotels created a synergistic app and guest program for hyper-customized stays\n\u2022 Sephora was voted #1 on Sailthru\u2019s first annual Retail Personalization Index\n\nBrand loyalty comes from true fans\u2014a coveted group whose loyalty has moved beyond \na simple like, follow, or reoccurring order. To capture, retain, and grow a fanbase requires \ngenuine personalization based on the individual and driven by digital innovation. \n\nStart with quality data\n\nData is the fuel for AI-driven technology, so regardless of how \u201cbig\u201d a data set is, a \ncompany\u2019s initial emphasis must begin with quality over quantity. Silo removal and the \nconsolidation of disparate data should be a focus from the outset, and quality should be \nmeasured by contextual compliance with user- or statistic-defined rules that are based on \ncorporate knowledge, business processes, and other conditions. For example: a company \ncould have multiple rules across divisions, languages, etc.\n\nIssues with data quality typically stem from system-level processes failure, poor software \nimplementation, or changes in data format that adversely impact source and/or target \ndata stores. For a system to be AI-ready, it must be designed to anticipate data feed and \nquality issues, with the proper responses already in place. \n\nWhat does that look like? An optimized system properly managing data input/output will \ninstantly identify quality threats and prevent cross-contamination with poor data, while \nnotifying appropriate users and denying access if necessary.\n\nOnce the foundations for quality data management are in place, proper data accumulation \ncan be achieved through optimized first-party data management, strategic second-party \ndata acquisition (purchased or shared), and properly vetted third-party data purchasing.\n\nLOYAL\nCUSTOMERS ARE\n\n5x\n\n5x\n\n7x\n\n4x\n\nMore likely to\nrepurchase.\n\nMore likely\nto forgive.\n\nMore likely to try\na new offering.\n\nMore likely\nto refer.\n\nhttp://www.businessinsider.com/sephora-leads-the-way-in-personalization-2017-9\n\n\nwhitepaper | Earn Fan Loyalty with Personalization 2.0 5\n\nUse AI to unlock potential\n\nWithout quality data, personalization accuracy is compromised. There aren\u2019t enough hours \nin a day to manually track the perpetually changing location, behavior, and context data \nthat consumers generate on a daily basis. Without these insights, however, companies are \nlimited to delivering experiences and content based on personas and segmentation\u2014not \nthe individual and her personal profile.\n\nArtificial intelligence empowers a company to automate:\n\n\u2022 Complex data tracking\n\u2022 Creation of unique customer profiles that update in real time\n\u2022 Profile data analysis for relevant content delivery and personalization\n\nAI can also alleviate corporate \u201cparalysis from analysis.\" The quest for bigger data \nmay delay or even prevent action at times due to the time and resources required to \naccumulate, sort, and scrub it. But with the speed at which today\u2019s marketplace is moving, \nthere\u2019s no time to waste. Artificial intelligence powers a growing list of technologies that \noptimize operations and processes allowing teams to focus talent and effort elsewhere.\n\nMachine learning is an excellent example of this.\n\nPersonalize at scale with machine learning\n\nWhy? Because it is impossible to personalize at scale without ML. \n\nImagine sending a unique tweet to each follower, crafting a Facebook ad for an audience of \none, or sending a custom mobile offer to every fan across the country\u2014one at a time. That\u2019s \nthe effort required for an individualistic, personalized approach and clearly, it\u2019s not feasible.\n\nML has largely untapped potential to identify value points, empower rapid response, and \ninform every tactical and creative aspect of genuine personalization. This fact is not lost \non the corporate majority according to MemSql as 61% of all companies, regardless of \nsize, see AI and ML as the most significant data initiatives for 2019. Meanwhile, industry \nleaders like Amazon, Google, and Microsoft already have a wide-margin lead in AI and ML \ntechnology investment that will only grow the longer a company waits to commit.\n\nNext steps\n\nCustom headlines and copy are no longer viable personalization for earning customer \nengagement in our content-saturated, attention-deficient society. As adblocking statistics \nclearly demonstrate, users dictate relevance\u2014or if marketing will be seen at all. The goal \nmust be to deliver content that is so compelling, it can\u2019t be ignored.\n\nhttps://globenewswire.com/news-release/2018/02/07/1335563/0/en/Survey-Finds-Machine-Learning-and-Artificial-Intelligence-are-Top-Business-Priorities.html\nhttps://www.forbes.com/forbes/welcome/?toURL=https://www.forbes.com/sites/louiscolumbus/2018/02/18/roundup-of-machine-learning-forecasts-and-market-estimates-2018/&refURL=&referrer=#70e752502225\nhttps://www.statista.com/statistics/804008/ad-blocking-reach-usage-us/\n\n\nwhitepaper | Earn Fan Loyalty with Personalization 2.0 6\n\nAt SoftServe, we are passionate advisors and providers of personalization strategy \nthrough big data, AI, and ML.

If \nproviders pursue improved outcomes, they typically face higher costs. If they work to \nlower costs, then patient care tends to suffer. In today\u2019s digital economy, this modus \noperandi need not apply. It is possible for healthcare administrators to achieve outstanding \nquality of care via scalable technologies while still maintaining cost. \n\nThe record suggests that despite significant investments in healthcare IT, including \n$37 billion spent in incentive payments by the US Federal Government\u2019s Medicare and \nMedicaid Services alone between 2011 and 2017, most organizations are enduring more \npain than gain as they work to integrate new IT systems with their operations. Efforts \nto persuade providers and other organizations to share information continue to lag, as \ndo efforts to enable different IT systems to communicate with one another, leaving data \nisolated in siloed databases. \n\nA recent survey published in the Harvard Business Review regarding the need for \ntransformative change in health care IT concludes:\n\n\u201c\u2026the impact of IT on reducing the costs and improving the quality of clinical care \nhas been modest... Relatively few organizations have taken the important next step \nof analyzing the wealth of data in their IT systems to understand the effectiveness \nof the care they deliver... instead of viewing IT as a transactional tool for billing, \nmonitoring, and error checking, organizations should embrace it as an instrument to \nhelp transform the way they deliver health care.\u201d\n\nThe current obstacles are clear. Today\u2019s IT infrastructure and systems across health \ncare tend to be rigid, difficult to change, and expensive to update with the latest clinical \nprotocols. Different systems cannot share information, making it practically impossible \nto create health records with a patient\u2019s complete medical history, much less make those \nrecords available to clinicians from diverse healthcare organizations. \n\nWithout information sharing, it is difficult to pool data, and nearly impossible to harness \nthe latest innovations in predictive analytics to guide clinical and operational decisions. \nEnabling an organization to do all of those would go a long way in addressing the trade-off \nbetween care and cost. Yet still, healthcare administrators from all sides of the industry \nremain reluctant to embrace more agile technology to period.\n\nWhen faced with the classic tradeoff between care vs. cost, pioneers across the healthcare \nindustry are discovering that there is a better way.\n\nThe operational opportunities that flow from migration to the cloud are already apparent \nand profound today. More importantly, the cloud is becoming foundational for healthcare \nsystems of the future. Value-based pricing, evidence-based medicine, community health \nmanagement and other universal objectives are becoming increasingly complex at the \nspeed of digital, and the coming healthcare ecosystem will inevitably gravitate toward \nthose organizations that make the move to the cloud, building better care while capturing \nmore actionable insights and lower costs.\n\nhttps://hbr.org/2017/11/the-it-transformation-health-care-needs\nhttps://hbr.org/2017/11/the-it-transformation-health-care-needs\n\n\nwhitepaper | Elevating Healthcare with the Cloud 3\n\nThe Cloud is on the rise\n\nCloud adoption in the healthcare industry has accelerated over the last few years and \nwill keep growing. According to one estimate, the global healthcare cloud computing \nmarket is forecasted to triple from 2015 to 2020, eventually reaching $9.48 billion. \nGartner predicts that by 2021, public cloud service providers will process more than 35% \nof healthcare providers\u2019 IT workloads.\n\nCost benefits are among the biggest advantages of moving to the cloud environment, in part \nbecause of the inherent efficiency of cloud-based computing, and in part because working in \nthe cloud makes it much easier to collect and work with the vast quantities of structured and \nunstructured data from diverse sources that characterize healthcare operations today. \n\nAssets such as medical imagery, open notes files, financial PDFs, and monitoring device \ndata are difficult to interface, yet are often collected and stored in the same location \ntoday. Unraveling these data knots within current IT systems is time-consuming and \nexpensive. Migrating data to the cloud opens superior new options for integration, \nanalysis, and predictive analytics.\n\nMigration is not without its challenges, which makes informed choices about choosing \nthe right cloud provider and overall implementation plan critical. The following is an \nexample of a healthcare leader making the move to the AWS Cloud and discovering that \nit is possible to simultaneously improve care, reduce costs, and evolve healthcare for the \nfuture.\n\nHealthcare success on the Cloud \n\nCase study 1\n\nMEDHOST\u00ae, a provider of enterprise, departmental, and healthcare engagement solutions \nto more than 1,100 healthcare facilities, set out to develop a new solution aimed at \nautomating and simplifying patient- and provider-related tasks and communications. \n\nThe goal was to provide patients and caregivers with online access to personal health \nrecords for easier, faster interaction with healthcare providers. MEDHOST partnered with \nSoftServe to create the new platform, \u201cYourCareCommunity,\u201d using a micro-service \narchitecture for a cloud-based portal on Amazon Web Services (AWS). \n\nThe AWS environment made it possible to build a comprehensive consumer relationship \nmanagement solution with multifaceted analytics fully integrated on a cloud data exchange \nplatform. The architecture recommended by SoftServe reflected deep knowledge of AWS \nand its sophisticated approach to software development, deployment and maintenance. \nAs a result of this initiative, MEDHOST now benefits from more agile and efficient IT \ndevelopment processes, as well as reduced costs and time to market.\n\nhttps://www.marketsandmarkets.com/PressReleases/cloud-computing-healthcare.asp\nhttps://hitinfrastructure.com/features/how-healthcare-providers-can-benefit-from-cloud-data-migration\nhttps://hitinfrastructure.com/news/understanding-healthcare-cloud-migration-for-cost-benefits\nhttps://www.softserveinc.com/en-us/our-work/medhost-healthcare-solution-aws-cloud/\nhttps://www.softserveinc.com/en-us/case-studies/tetimonials/spillman-technologies-(14)/\n\n\nwhitepaper | Elevating Healthcare with the Cloud 4\n\nCause and effect\n\nWhether migrating with an onsite, remote, or hybrid approach, the cloud is the logical (if not \ninevitable) solution for all companies wishing to keep pace with the speed of digital while \nfutureproofing sustainable success. The following are additional benefits to cloud migration \nthat should be strongly considered given the challenges facing the healthcare industry today \nlike never before.\n\nDitch the data center\n\nTo keep pace with the vast amounts of data generated daily, future-facing healthcare \nleaders should look to the cloud to more easily scale and keep pace. Doing so will \ninevitably reduce costs for patients, providers, and payers\u2014while improving overall \nhealthcare quality, efficiency, and patient safety. With AWS and SoftServe, it\u2019s possible to \nscale without limits.\n\nBetter, stronger, faster\n\nThe cloud combined with AI-driven technologies (ML, NLP, and AR/VR) is a combination \nthat is already changing the status quo for the better by enhancing personalization, \nexperience, and gamification. These advances strengthen not only service and cross-\nmatrix communication and collaboration, but also competitive differentiation. Without the \ncloud, the speed and agility required to keep pace at scale would be impossible.\n\nWHAT WE SEE\nAn era of patient emprowerment that blends PHYSICAL and DIGITAL. \n\n\n\nwhitepaper | Elevating Healthcare with the Cloud 5\n\nAmazon Web Services (AWS) and SoftServe: \nAccelerating advances in healthcare\n\nAmazon Web Services focuses on helping healthcare providers deliver efficient, quality \ncare to patients by reducing the time needed to run existing workloads and by providing \naccess to useful analytics capabilities. AWS offers a broad set of global cloud-based \nproducts including compute, storage, databases, analytics, networking, mobile, \ndeveloper tools, management tools, IoT, security and enterprise applications. These \nservices help organizations move faster, lower IT costs, and scale. \n\nAWS is trusted by the largest enterprises and most innovative start-ups across the \nhealthcare sector to power a wide variety of workloads including: web and mobile \napplications, data processing and warehousing, storage, archive, and many others. \nAWS prioritizes the task of meeting all security and privacy requirements, and eases \ninformation security by managing over 1800 security controls.\n\nSoftServe Inc., a leading global digital implementation expert and consulting company, \ndelivers innovative AWS solutions that leverage the power of the cloud on behalf \nof numerous healthcare organizations. SoftServe has also achieved AWS DevOps \nCompetency staus, demonstrating our deep experience with AWS processes.\n\nAchieving the AWS DevOps Competency differentiates SoftServe as a member of the AWS \nPartner Network, demonstrating technical proficiency and proven customer success in \ncontinuous integration and delivery, monitoring, logging and performance.

They needed \nclean and informative data visualization to assure easy and quick access to \nall slices of data, communicate the company brand. The client\u2019s CFO and CTO \nfelt the needed speed and impact was lacking and adoption was limited. \n\n  \n\n\n\ncase study | Financial Dashboard Solutions for One of Canada\u2019s Biggest Retailers 2\n\nProject Description\n\nThe client consulted SoftServe to leverage its comprehensive, end-to-end success \nframework for outside-in and crowd sourced ideation, market validated concept \ndevelopment, and commercialization. \n\nDuring research and information gathering, SoftServe utilized a number of ideation \ntechniques, including user interviews, journey maps, report life circle, and features \nbrainstorming to better collect and understand what the main flows were,\nand prioritize requirements. \n\nThese ideas needed to be refined into market-validated concepts ready for \nimplementation. The concepts, assumptions, and market feasibility had to be verified \nthrough an iterative process. Nonfunctional clickable prototypes gave SoftServe engineers \nthe ability to test the solutions before actually building them, which helped to avoid \nmistakes and thus saved time and money. Each flow was prototyped and tested before \ndevelopment. The Invision app was used as a prototyping tool. \n\nA responsive design of dashboards provided an optimal viewing and interaction \nexperience -easy reading and navigation with less need for resizing, panning, and scrolling \n- across a wide range of devices, from desktop computers to mobile phones. To provide \na timely implementation of a solution, SoftServe maximized existing tools and built the \ndesign on top of existing backend components which greatly accelerated development and \nsaved previous investments into existing backend tools. \n\nA unified UI components library was created which communicates existing reusable \ncomponents with their states inside the team and for other projects in order to \nprovide common user experience across the organization. Using a Zeplin tool provided \ndevelopers with sizes and attributes for all layouts and components, including color, font \nsize, margin and grid settings. \n\nCreating and delivering a well-planned and executed implementation approach is key \nto driving outcomes and value for the business. SoftServe brought its engineering \nexpertise and human-centric experience design knowledge to create a range of \ndashboard and visualization solutions including: \n\n\u2022 Finance Dashboard - this provides users with short and long term views of finance \nperformance on key metrics such as sales, shipments and margins. Users can compare \nresults vs. prior year or budget. They have the ability to drill into the results based on \ndimensions such as product, deal type, channel and province, and product attributes \nsuch as seasonality and product profile. \n\n\n\ncase study | Financial Dashboard Solutions for One of Canada\u2019s Biggest Retailers 3\n\n\u2022 Inventory Management Dashboard - highlights risk areas to allow the user to quickly \nidentify what areas require immediate attention. It provides historical and projected \nviews to key inventory management metrics such as shipments, receipts and projected \ninventory; and gives the ability to drill down based on dimensions such as product, deal \ntype, channel, and product attributes. \n\n\u2022 Financial Explorer - provides users with short and long term views of CTR retail \nperformance on key metrics such as sales, shipments and margins.  \n\n\u2022 Report Repository - is a unified reports library, which provides users with and easy \naccess to financial data and centralized access to reports. The goal is to transition \nfrom pushing data to employees to pulling it in when needed. This saves the time \nby providing discovery capabilities to find reports, manage them, and keep efforts \nfrom being duplicated. It keeps records up to date and accurate across the entire \norganization. \n\n\u2022 IT Capital Reporting \u2013 this tool provides users with short and long term views of IT \nCapital Projects performance on key metrics such as GROSS, CAP, OPEX and CAP Rate. \nUsers can drill into the results based on dimensions such as EVP, IT VP, Portfolio, Lens \nand others. \n\n\u2022 Margin Building Blocks - this tool provides users with short and long term views of \nmargin drivers. Users will have the ability to review biggest EGM Rate Drivers and \nTop Net Cost Impact SKUs. Users have the ability to drill into the results based on \ndimensions such as hierarchy, brand, SKU status and others. \n\nValue Delivered\n\nTo achieve better data visualization, the client consulted SoftServe to understand and \ntransform the how analysts were interpreting the data versus how they were getting it. \nSoftServe built custom dashboard charts and a flexible filtering system that supported \nthe business needs. \n\nThe primary strategic goal of our involvement was achieved \u2013 enhancing the speed and \nimpact that was requested. SoftServe has changed the way the client consumes reports \nand they use these in their decision-making process. \n\nKey achievements realized from implementing these dashboard solutions include:\n\n\u2022 Up to 4x faster and cheaper - Re-using some of the work from the initial project helped \nensure that later projects were delivered 4x faster and cheaper, without sacrificing \nquality or functionality. \n\n\u2022 Widespread internal adoption by 300+ employees. \n\u2022 Proof-of-Concept (PoC) Factory - The first initial project \u201cFinancial Explorer\u201d was so \n\nsuccessful so that it gave our client\u2019s stakeholders credibility to suggest and implement \nprojects they want, which evolved into PoC factory where they work with SoftServe to \ngather requirements, build a clickable prototype, demonstrate it to executives and seek \nfunding, and then implement it.

With over 200 years in the banking business, \nthey offer products and services such as new online banking \nplatforms, mobile payments and analytics tools within banking,  \nasset management, and insurance. \n\nBusiness Challenge\n\nOur client needed to build an ingestion pipeline to extract data from \nsource systems and deliver this data to GPDW to allow the company \nto pursue its Data-as-a-Service approach within the group. The client\u2019s \nend users would benefit from easy access to consolidated data with \nbetter quality and availability and this would help our client provide \nnew financial services and improve existing ones.

Streams from  \nheterogeneous data sources were integrated with a centralized Hadoop cluster.  \nThe number of legacy systems involved was around 1000.\n\nAll development was done within an established DevOps framework and followed an \nestablished build pipeline. Working within this DevOps framework, SoftServe utilized  \nthe following technologies:\n\n\u2022 Source Control: GIT & Bitbucket\n\u2022 Programming Language: Scala\n\u2022 Build server: Bamboo using Maven\n\u2022 Artefact storage: Nexus\n\u2022 Deployment: Puppet\n\u2022 Unit Tests: ScalaTest\n\nOur team organized delivery around six operational processes:\n\nSource Onboarding Process \u2013 this was the preparation of infrastructure configurations \nfor the source systems. Due to security and access management requirements, each \nsource system had to be located in a different data zone on the Hadoop platform with \ndedicated folders, databases and access groups on Active Directory. Our team had to  \nraise multiple infrastructure request to Hadoop, Unix and Access Management teams  \nand coordinate to verify their completion.\n\nDevelopment and QA Process \u2013 this involved preparing configurations for new data  \nfeeds and testing ingestions on a QA environment. All configurations are in source \nrepository and follow a gitflow process through development. The QA process requires \n100% test coverage with full traceability in Jira.\n\nProduction Release Process \u2013 using guidelines from the client for the change \nmanagement process based on ITIL framework and tools, SoftServe leveraged a \ncontinuous delivery approach and automation tools on the test and production \nenvironments to release new configurations. Each release involved automated  \nchecks - one before the release to verify correctness of infrastructure and ingest \nconfigurations; and one after to verify the correctness of deployment.\n\nProduction Maintenance Process \u2013 investigating and resolving issues on production. \nAfter ingesting data to production our team regularly reviews ingestion status using \nCloudera Manager tools and custom dashboards configured on a big data analytics \nplatform. They investigate errors and issues and coordinate efforts across multiple  \nteams to fix them.\n\n\n\ncase study Centuries Old Bank Consolidates Data On Legacy Systems with Managed Capacity Service Model 3\n\nChange Management and Reconciliation Process - our team ingests data into Hadoop  \nin parallel with existing legacy data warehouse solution that will be decommissioned in  \nthe future. This platform is currently live on production and we analyze their releases  \nand identify new data feeds or changes to existing data feeds that should also  \ncorrespond with changes on our platform.\n\nContinuous Improvement Process \u2013 our team performs biweekly retrospectives  \nto improve the above processes. Each process has a designated process owner \n who is responsible for keeping the process documentation up-to-date and  \nintroducing new changes.\n\nSoftServe implemented a KPI driven delivery, managing fully transparent agreed  \nservice levels.\n\nValue Delivered\n\nSoftServe established a capacity managed process based on KPIs for ingestion that could \nbe correlated based on data supply. This established an optimal process for efficient \ningestion as it can process sources per period of time and delivery unit per period of time, \nsupporting data quality metrics.\n\nSoftServe met the goals of our client's IT strategy to migrate and consolidate data held \non numerous legacy systems onto the firm\u2019s big data platform, which uses the Cloudera \ndistribution of Hadoop.\n\nSpecific business goals within this group focused around the following primary drivers:\n\n\u2022 Economics - to optimize costs, our client\u2019s data engineering team leveraged different \nlocations within Eastern and Central Europe\n\n\u2022 Competence \u2013 working with a partner with a high level of competence within the \nHadoop environment with a proven success record in providing similar services to \nsimilar customers in the financial sector\n\n\u2022 Scalability \u2013 accommodating for incoming demand to gradually increase volumes until a \nstable state was achieved\n\n\n\nABOUT US\nSoftServe is a digital authority that advises and provides at the \ncutting-edge of technology.

In their research, the team explored the idea of transferring contact \nwith a physical object tracked to its full virtual copy in virtual reality, giving the user the \nphysical interaction with the object while staying in virtual reality.\n\nThe primary obstacle was the physical interaction component as there was no simple way \nof transferring hand touch sensing due to the inability to track fingers and objects in the \nreal world with sufficient accuracy. However, interaction with objects is not limited to gentle \ntouch and can include interactions with applied force. In such cases the user\u2019s sensory \ninputs are limited to resistance and surface hardness as a result of their interaction.\n\nThe R&D team\u2019s task then moved to selecting the appropriate intermediate tool that  \nwould let them maintain the interaction as close to reality as possible without limiting  \nthe user\u2019s sense of interaction. Martial arts by nature is a forced interaction with a set  \nof equipment such as punching bags, wall bags, and intermediate sports equipment  \nthat protects the user from injury. \n\nThe Vive Tracker was selected for this application as it is a small device able to track its own \nposition and report this to the VR environment. The equipment selected to exist in both \nthe virtual and real spaces consists of a punching bag, boxing gloves and sneakers. To keep \nuser motivated the team developed multiple modes of interaction and included gamified \nexperiences to make the experience more engaging.\n\nFor software solution base, the team utilized Unity as a fast, reliable prototyping tool with \nadditional assets for resolving separate tasks.\n\n\n\ncase study SoftServe\u2019s VR Gym Brings a New Level of Virtual Reality to Boxing 3\n\nValue Delivered\n\nThe application is a virtual boxing ring experience with rich graphics and sound. The \nexperience consists of predefined gamified modes to keep the user engaged. \n\nIt operates in three modes: \n\n\u2022 Tutoring mode \u2013 teaching users to box with previously prepared hand recordings and \nvisualizations. \n\n\u2022 Rhythm mode \u2013 punching sessions aligned with song rhythms, creating an experience \nsimilar to dance arcades.\n\n\u2022 Sparring mode \u2013 sparring with a virtual boxing partner. \n\n\n\ncase study SoftServe\u2019s VR Gym Brings a New Level of Virtual Reality to Boxing 4\n\nThis application is not limited to virtual reality for the martial arts sports, but also can be \nimplemented in a wide range of uses across multiple industry verticals, for example:\n\n\u2022 Healthcare \u2013 during post-injury medical rehabilitation it is important to monitor the \nprogress of a patient visually using measurement tools. Tracking of the human body \nduring exercise can provide critical information about the current state of rehabilitation \nand progress.\n\n\u2022 Personnel Training - in industries that require the training of personnel, conducting \nthis in virtual reality can reproduce a range of different environments in a safe manner \n- from everyday working conditions to hazardous environments.

This enables \nmore effective planning, activation, and \nmeasurement for marketers and business \ndecision makers alike, fueling the next \ngeneration of insight-driven marketing.\n\nBusiness Challenge\n\nTo increase costs effectiveness and improve \nlevels of support, Blis needed to migrate its \nservices and data to Google Cloud Platform \n(GCP).\n\n\n\ncase study |    G\u0421P migration supports optimized cost effectiveness and cloud experience for advanced\n      location data leader\n\n2\n\nProject Description\n\nFrom a technical point of view, the project \nintroduced two major challenges: high \ninfrastructure complexity and strict \nmigration downtime requirements.\n\nThe legacy infrastructure consisted \nof over 150 instances and services \ndistributed across five different regions \nall over the world, with a centralized \ncore infrastructure and regional centers \nresponsible for low-latency incoming \nrequests processing. Services included \ncustom Java and C++ applications partially \nmanaged in containerized infrastructure, \nOLTP PostgreSQL and MySQL databases, \nanalytics databases in RedShift and \nDruid, distributed Kafka and Cassandra \nclusters, and central Hadoop cluster \nfor Spark-based ETL processing etc. \nFinally, the overall amount of data in \nall the repositories exceeded 5PB.\n\nDue to the business specifics, Blis \nneeded to ensure zero-downtime \nmigration for the client-facing services \nand to limit central infrastructure \ndowntime by 20 minutes maximum.\n\nAs a first stage of the project, SoftServe \nconducted a discovery phase in which \nBlis\u2019 infrastructure was analyzed to \nidentify technologies in use, services \ndependencies, and migration requirements. \nAs a result, SoftServe developed a \ndetailed step-by-step migration plan \nthat mapped legacy applications to GCP \nservices, described applications migration \norder, and was heavily focused on the \ndowntime elimination or minimization \napproach for the whole project. \n\nNext, the GCP adaptation phase of the \nproject was executed. SoftServe engineers \n\nprepared both infrastructure and customer \napplications for GCP migration without \nactually changing the production solution. \nSpecifically, GCP projects structure, \nnetwork infrastructure, and security \nframework based on Google OAuth2 were \ncreated and integrated with the existing \nsolution. Infrastructure deployment was \nautomated with Deployment Manager and \nAnsible. All containerized applications were \nmoved to Kubernetes Engine with Helm.\n\nIn parallel, existing applications were \nre-engineered to work in the new \ninfrastructure and technologies. For \nexample, RedShift data warehouse and \nrelated ETL pipelines were reworked \nto use Google BigQuery solution. \nOther GCP services in use were GCS, \nCloud SQL, Cloud Dataproc, Cloud \nComposer, and Cloud Memorystore.\n\nIn addition to services adaptation, a set \nof solutions was verified or developed \nat this stage to facilitate low-downtime \nmigration, from standard Kafka and \nCassandra replications to completely \ncustom synchronization logic for \nOLTP databases and ETL pipelines.\n\nWhen both GCP infrastructure and customer \napplications were ready, the step-by-step \nmigration phase began. Client-facing services \nwere deployed to GCP infrastructure and \nused in parallel with the legacy systems to \nguarantee zero-downtime migration. For \nthe core, heavily data-oriented services, \ninitial data migration was conducted \nand data synchronization services were \nrunning to keep the minimum data \ngap between production and new GCP \nservices. Finally, the full core infrastructure \nswitchover to GCP was executed \ntogether with final data synchronization \nsteps, which met the customer\u2019s 20 \nminutes downtime requirements.\n\n\n\ncase study |    G\u0421P migration supports optimized cost effectiveness and cloud experience for advanced\n      location data leader\n\n3\n\nKey Technologies\n\n\u2022 Kubernetes engine (GKE) - main \ncontainers orchestration solution for \nmost of Blis\u2019 applications\n\n\u2022 Big Query - was used as a managed and \nscalable data warehouse. Big Query \nreplaced RedShift cluster used in the \nlegacy infrastructure\n\n\u2022 Cloud Dataproc and Cloud Composer \n- were used to implement and \norchestrate Blis\u2018 ETL pipelines. Cloud \nDataproc and Composer replaced  EMR \nand Luigi solutions used before\n\n\u2022 Kafka, Cassandra, Cloud Memorystore, \nDruid, and Cloud SQL databases - were \nused by both client-facing services and \nETL pipelines and were migrated with no \nmajor changes\n\nValue Delivered\n\nBlis achieved GCP migration within a tight \nschedule.

SoftServe \nwas tasked with using Google Spanner \n(vs DB2) for these services to mimic the \nbehavior of the existing ones. The appli-\ncation stack is Spring-cloud centric and \nuses Java programming language. The main \ncommunication channels of the application \nare REST and Kafka as a message log.\n\nSoftServe moved part of the storage from \nthe client\u2019s private cloud and on-prem \ndatabase to the public cloud (GCP). In \naddition to the ability of horizontal scaling \nof data storage provided by GCP, SoftServe \ngave the client a better understanding of \nhybrid cloud solutions from technological, \norganizational, and business perspectives.\n\nTo move data from a live system to the cloud \nand mitigate the possibility of data loss and \nmaintain the ability to remain flexible in \nperforming go/no-go decisions at any stage \nof the project, SoftServe created a specific \ntransition process which is a combination \nof the hot-warm data recovery and canary \ndeployment. \n\nSoftServe also designed and implemented \na dedicated audit tool to better ensure \ndata consistency. This tool selects random \ndata in the background (silent mode) and \nperforms its consistency comparison  \u2014 \nconsidering data model differences caused \nby technology limitations and optimizations \nmade. To keep the existing SLAs along with \nthe advantages of cloud storage, SoftServe \nrevisited and optimized the database-appli-\ncation approach to reduce the network and \ndatabase load.\n\nAs our client continues developing the appli-\ncation, SoftServe developed a plan to continue \ndevelopment concurrently with the migration \nprocess.\n\nValue Delivered\n\nS oftServe delivered a timely migration \nof a portion of our client\u2019s application, \nproving that such a migration of data \n\nwas possible.

If you\u2019re dealing with people\u2019s \nsensitive personal and health data, you \nwant to ensure that your system is secure. \nOur client\u2014a global virtual healthcare \ntechnology company\u2014wanted to expand \nits business into the governmental sector. \nTo do that, they needed to ensure an even \nhigher level of cloud security protocols than \nbefore. \n\nWhen working with the government and \nproviding cloud-based services, one of \nthe best ways to meet their high level \nof standards and security is to obtain a \nFedRAMP Authorization. FedRAMP is a \nU.S. government program that \u201cprovides \na standardized security framework for \nall cloud products and services\u201d and is \nrecognized by all federal agencies within \nthe executive branch.  \n\nTo ensure their solutions and services \nmet this standard, our client approached \nSoftServe to help build a FedRAMP-\ncompliant cloud environment and CI/CD \nflow. The client also wanted to improve \noverall multi-account and multi-region \nusability, repeatability, and consistency, \nas well as create centralized networking, \nsecurity, and logging solutions.  \n\nHaving previously designed and \nimplemented greenfield concepts to \nenhance security, automate and standardize \nprocesses, and improve customer workloads, \nour SoftServe team was confident that they \ncould handle this project.  \n\nOur experts knew that this type of \nsetup required a Landing Zone\u2014a well-\narchitected AWS Organization structure \nthat allows multiple customizable AWS \naccounts and organizational units. They \nalso knew that AWS Control Tower was \nthe best way to create this Landing Zone. \nTo deliver on the client\u2019s goals, such an \nenvironment also required a hybrid cross-\nregion network setup with on-premises \ndata centers and a large set of guardrails \nand Service Control Policies (SCP). Lastly, \nthe client needed a centralized AWS \nsecurity services-integrated logging \nsolution to best comply with the FedRAMP \nsecurity program protocols. \n\nOnce our SoftServe team understood the \nsize and scope of this project, they divided \nit into three phases.  \n\nCase Study |    Transform system security, streamline processes, and automate CI/CD flow with AWS 2\n\nBuild a FedRAMP compliant environment, enhance security protocols, improve  \nmulti-account setup, and automate processes using Landing Zone, AWS Control \nTower, and AWS Organizations. \n\nhttps://www.fedramp.gov/\n\n\nIn the first phase, SoftServe built out \nthe greenfield multi-account AWS \nenvironment. This ensured that the \nframework complied with the FedRAMP \nsecurity standards from the very beginning. \nTo start, our experts created a Landing \nZone managed by AWS Control Tower. \nUsing the Control Tower customization \norchestrator, CloudFormation templates, \nand AWS security control policies, our team \ncustomized the Landing Zone baseline to \nprovide each new AWS account enrollment \na set of AWS resources and services. \n\nHaving routinely partnered with AWS, our \nexperts know that AWS Organizations\u2014a \nservice that lets you centrally manage \nmultiple accounts\u2014is the foundation \nof a well-architected multi-account \nenvironment. The Landing Zone built by \nthe SoftServe team required a proper \nAWS Organization and nested accounts \nstructure that included centralized logging, \nsecurity, and networks, a management \naccount, and more. \n\nAs the SoftServe engineers were \nconstructing these elements, they realized \nthat the client needed a complex network \ntopology as well. At the time, the client\u2019s \nnetwork account contained shared VPCs \nand was meant to centrally manage the \nnetwork components. In order to improve \nsecurity and usability, our team of experts \nestablished complex network connections \nbetween AWS VPCs, branch offices, and \non-premises servers using AWS Transit \nGateway (TGW), VPN, VPC endpoints, edge \nrouters, and multiple other components. \n\nSince the highest levels of security \nwere needed to meet the FedRAMP \nstandards, SoftServe integrated numerous \ncomponents into the Landing Zone that \nwould automatically deploy with each \nnew AWS account. First, the AWS Security \nHub and AWS GuardDuty services were \nset up on the AWS Organization with \nan administrator/member relationship. \nAWS Security acts as an administrator \nand serves as a central place for security \nmanagement. All other accounts are \nconsidered member accounts and \ntherefore cannot disassociate themselves \nfrom the administrator account, ensuring \nthe same level of security throughout. \n\nNext, an AWS Logging account was \nprovided as a central place for storing \nvarious logs from different accounts, such \nas AWS data and management logs like \nAWS CloudTrail, VPC flow logs, DNS, and \nmore. A set of SCPs that met the FedRAMP \nrequirements were also implemented, \nmeaning the system would deny unused \nregions and services or non-compliant \nparameters and options as security \nmeasures. \n\nThe SoftServe team also created a custom \nAWS Config Conformance Pack that \nincluded both FedRAMP and Control Tower \nrules and deployed it across the entire \norganization. Lastly, they integrated the \nAWS Single Sign-On (AWS SSO) service \nwith the client\u2019s OKTA identity provider. \nThis synchronized with the client\u2019s Active \nDirectory and enabled a single user \nmanagement system at the organization \nlevel, allowing only SSO users login access \nto the AWS Console.  \n\nCase Study |    Transform system security, streamline processes, and automate CI/CD flow with AWS 3\n\n\n\nLET\u2019S TALK about how SoftServe can help \nmeet your toughest inventory challenges \nusing AI/ML, big data, and cloud solutions. \n\nAfter all of these services and systems were \nbuilt and implemented, the second phase \nof this project focused on enhancing and \nautomating the client\u2019s CI/CD approaches \nand pipelines. Using the Infrastructure \nas Code guiding principles, our SoftServe \nexperts established the necessary \napplication infrastructure resources \nwith Terraform code in conjunction with \nTerragrunt. In addition, they introduced a \nspecific Terraform/Terragrunt repository \nstructure. \n\nThe client\u2019s CI/CD was then improved \nusing GitOps practices and immutability \nprinciples and orchestrated using Jenkins \npipelines and Terraform code. The Jenkins \npipeline bakes Packer AMI images and then \nuses AWS KMS keys to distribute them \nacross different AWS accounts. It also \ncreates docker images which Terraform \ndelivers, deploying them into AWS EKS as \nHelm charts.  \n\nLastly, our SoftServe engineers enhanced \nthe security of the client\u2019s Kubernetes \nservices by introducing AWS IRSA model \n(IAM Roles for Service Accounts) on AWS \nEKS clusters. \n\nAfter all of that, the client was so \nimpressed with the process and systems \nimprovements and the enhanced security, \nthat they decided to adopt the same \nprinciples for other AWS environments as \nthe final phase of this project. \n\nUltimately, SoftServe successfully \ncustomized AWS Control Tower and \ndelivered a complex yet well-defined AWS \nOrganization and account structure. This \nstructure included greenfield repeatable \nenvironments based on the Landing Zone \nconcept and best practices. Our experts \ndesigned and implemented network \ncomponents, configured AWS security \nservices, and centralized security controls, \nensuring all information was safe and \nsecure. Finally, we improved our client\u2019s \nCI/CD workflows and GitOps practices. \nEach of these elements led to our client \nhaving a FedRAMP compliant AWS setup, \npaving their way to achieve the FedRAMP \ncertification for their products as they \nventure into the government sector. \n\nSoftServe\u2019s experience and expertise \ncombined with AWS products and services \nmeant that our client could expand and \nscale their global virtual healthcare \ntechnology business, reassured that their \nenvironment met the highest security \nrequirements.  \n\nCase Study |    Transform system security, streamline processes, and automate CI/CD flow with AWS 4\n\nhttps://www.softserveinc.com/en-us/contact\n\n\nABOUT SOFTSERVE\n\nWe are a digital authority made up of advisors, engineers, and designers \nwho deliver innovation, quality, and speed to elevate and accelerate our \nclients\u2019 digital journeys.\n\nOur approach is built on a foundation of empathetic, human-focused \nexperience design that ensures value and continuity from concept to \nrelease.\n\nWE IDENTIFY WHERE YOU ARE.                   \nWE PREPARE YOU FOR THE ROAD AHEAD.\u00a0 \nWE TAKE YOU WHERE YOU NEED TO GO.\u00a0\nVisit our website, blog, LinkedIn, Facebook, and Twitter pages.\n\nNORTH AMERICAN HQ\n\n201 W 5th Street, Suite 1550 \nAustin, TX 78701 \nUSA +1 866 687 3588 (USA)           \n+1 647 948 7638 (Canada) \n\nEUROPEAN HQ\n\n30 Cannon Street\nLondon EC4M 6XH\nUnited Kingdom  \n+44 333 006 4341\n\ninfo@softserveinc.com \nwww.softserveinc.com\n\n\n", "LocationURL": "https://www.softserveinc.com/files/cases/transform-system-security-streamline-processes-and-automate-ci-cd-flow-with-aws.pdf", "id": "sw-rf-818", "FileName": "transform-system-security-streamline-processes-and-automate-ci-cd-flow-with-aws.pdf", "Storage": "SoftServe Website", "Published": "2022-03-01T13:18:47Z", "FileType": ".pdf"}, {"Category": null, "content": "\nUpdate Legacy Infrastructure \nand Integrate Old Systems with \nSalesforce\n\nCASE \nSTUDY\n\n\n\nNew business demands and technological \nneeds required the client to update its \ninfrastructure and make the switch to \nSalesforce from a CRM that the company \nhad outgrown. \n\nThe Client\n\nOur client is a provider of financial \nservices to the agricultural \nindustry.

It allows users to integrate with different \nauthentication methods, which may be more flexible than \nAWS Secrets Manager, and can be used to manage other \ntypes of secrets such as certificates and Secure Socket Shell \n(SSH) credentials.\n\n\n\nC\nas\n\ne \nSt\n\nud\ny \n\n  |\n    \n\nSo\nft\n\nSe\nrv\n\ne \nTe\n\nam\ns \n\nW\nit\n\nh \nH\n\nas\nhi\n\nCo\nrp\n\n V\nau\n\nlt \nto\n\n S\ntr\n\nen\ngt\n\nhe\nn \n\nSe\ncu\n\nri\nty\n\n3\n\nA dedicated team from SoftServe met with our client to develop a series of \nbusiness and technical goals:\n\n\u2022 Securely store and manage \nsensitive information, such \nas financial data, confidential \ndocuments, and customer \ninformation. \n\n\u2022 Control access to sensitive \ninformation by setting granular \npermissions and policies. \n\n\u2022 Automate the process of rotating \nand revoking access to secrets \nand credentials. \n\n\u2022 Audit and track access to sensitive \ninformation to detect and prevent \nunauthorized access. \n\n\u2022 Integrate with existing \ninfrastructure and tools, such as \ncloud providers, Kubernetes, and \nCI/CD pipelines. \n\n\u2022 Simplify the process of encrypting \nand decrypting data in transit and \nat rest.  \n\n\u2022 Help meet compliance \nrequirements by providing a \nsecure, auditable, and compliant \nenvironment for sensitive \ninformation. \n\n\u2022 Streamline the process of \nmanaging and sharing secrets \nwith third-party services and \ntools. \n\n\u2022 Enable secure, programmatic \naccess to secrets and credentials \nusing APIs. \n\n\u2022 Store and manage secrets for \ndifferent environments such \nas development, staging, and \nproduction.\n\nPLANNING\n\nBUSINESS GOALS:\n\nTECHNICAL GOALS:\n\nExpand the client\u2019s \ntechnical team\u2019s security \nexpertise.\n\nQuickly resolve any task \nor request issues.\n\nDeliver a smooth \nand efficient project \nimplementation.\n\n\n\nC\nas\n\ne \nSt\n\nud\ny \n\n  |\n    \n\nSo\nft\n\nSe\nrv\n\ne \nTe\n\nam\ns \n\nW\nit\n\nh \nH\n\nas\nhi\n\nCo\nrp\n\n V\nau\n\nlt \nto\n\n S\ntr\n\nen\ngt\n\nhe\nn \n\nSe\ncu\n\nri\nty\n\n4 THE SOLUTION\nWe crafted a solution to our client\u2019s desire to securely manage and control \naccess to sensitive information that satisfied many requirements, our selection \nof HashiCorp Vault:\n\nOverall, using HashiCorp Vault to securely manage and control access to sensitive \ninformation improves our client\u2019s digital security, efficiency, compliance, and workflow, \nultimately leading to more streamlined and cost-effective operations.\n\nBy using Vault to securely store and manage sensitive \ninformation, our client\u2019s customers could reduce the \nrisk of data breaches and unauthorized access to their \nsensitive information.\n\nVault could help our client meet compliance requirements \nby providing a secure, auditable, and compliant \nenvironment for sensitive information.\n\nBy automating the process of rotating and revoking \naccess to secrets and credentials, our client could \nstreamline their workflow and increase their \norganization\u2019s efficiency.\n\nVault\u2019s audit and tracking features would allow our client \nto detect and prevent unauthorized access to sensitive \ninformation, which provides better visibility and control \nover their data.\n\nHashiCorp Vault integrates with existing infrastructure and \ntools, such as cloud providers, Kubernetes, and CI/CD pipelines, \nallowing our client to easily manage secrets across different \nenvironments, improving their overall workflow.\n\nOur client could share secrets and credentials with third-party \nservices and tools, making it easier for teams to collaborate \neffectively.\n\nHashiCorp Vault enables secure, programmatic access to \nsecrets and credentials using APIs, making it easier for our \nclient to access sensitive information.\n\nBy using Vault to manage and control access to sensitive \ninformation, our client could reduce the costs associated \nwith managing and securing data, such as the cost of hiring \nadditional security staff and data breach costs.\n\nINCREASED  \nSECURITY\n\nCOMPLIANCE\n\nIMPROVED  \nEFFICIENCY\n\nBETTER \nVISIBILITY\n\nINTEGRATION\n\nIMPROVED \nCOLLABORATION\n\nEASY ACCESS\n\nCOST-EFFECTIVE\n\n\n\nC\nas\n\ne \nSt\n\nud\ny \n\n  |\n    \n\nSo\nft\n\nSe\nrv\n\ne \nTe\n\nam\ns \n\nW\nit\n\nh \nH\n\nas\nhi\n\nCo\nrp\n\n V\nau\n\nlt \nto\n\n S\ntr\n\nen\ngt\n\nhe\nn \n\nSe\ncu\n\nri\nty\n\n5\n\nTHE PROJECT\n\nT he SoftServe team created the project system \ndesign with the goal of increasing security, \nspeeding up time to market, and achieving client \n\nsatisfaction. The team performed the integration \naccording to HashiCorp\u2019s best practices and \nrecommendations. \n\nSoftServe began by investigating our client\u2019s existing \ncloud infrastructure, which consisted of a few hundred \nmicroservices hosted in a managed Kubernetes cluster \nprovisioned in AWS EC2 instances and integrated with \nRDS, S3, and AWS Secrets Management. Following \nthis review, the team proposed a solution for a secure \nauthentication mechanism. \n\nNext came the process of installing and configuring \nHashiCorp Vault. This included setting up a dedicated \nserver for Vault and configuring it to authenticate with \nKubernetes. Then, Kubernetes authentication was \nset up, including the creation of a Kubernetes service \naccount, and configuring it to authenticate with Vault.\n\nHASHICORP VAULT ON AMAZON EKS\n\nAWS CLOUD\n\nVPS\n\nAZ-1 AZ-2 AZ-3\n\nVault Client\n\nVault Server Vault Server\n\nPublic Subnet\n\nPrivate Subnet\n\n\u2022 Enabled AWS KMS auto-unseal\n\u2022 Enabled Cluster HA\n\u2022 Enabled Raft storage for HA \n\n\u2022 Enabled Vault audit to AWS CloudWatch\n\u2022 Enabled SSL at Vault UI endpoint \n\nSoftServe\u2019s team then created and stored secrets in HashiCorp Vault, such as database \ncredentials, API keys, and other sensitive information. Secrets were injected into Kubernetes \npods, including the configuration of the Kubernetes pods to authenticate with Vault and \nretrieve secrets at runtime. This action can be performed by using a Sidecar container \nor Kubernetes-Vault-monitoring and logging to track access to secrets, and to detect and \nrespond to any potential security incidents. It was also necessary to set up the periodic \nrotation and revocation of secrets when necessary.\n\n\n\nC\nas\n\ne \nSt\n\nud\ny \n\n  |\n    \n\nSo\nft\n\nSe\nrv\n\ne \nTe\n\nam\ns \n\nW\nit\n\nh \nH\n\nas\nhi\n\nCo\nrp\n\n V\nau\n\nlt \nto\n\n S\ntr\n\nen\ngt\n\nhe\nn \n\nSe\ncu\n\nri\nty\n\n6\n\nDYNAMIC \nSECRETS  \nFOR DBS\n\n01\n01 02\n\n03\n\n02\n03\n\nSECRETS AS A SERVICE:\n\nThe Application Pool requests database \ncredentials\n\nVault creates a new user in a database and returns \na username and password to the application\n\nThe application connects to the database using \ncredentials provided by Vault\n\nLease duration and Lease renewable are configured.\n\nApplication \nPool\n\nHashiCorp \nVault\n\nPostgreSQL\n\nFinally, it was important to test the \nentire project integration to ensure that \neverything worked as expected.

However, like so many other technology trends, its \nevolution has roots that stretch back over decades.\n\nTo help make sense of the current landscape, the SoftServe Digital \nTransformation Report 2017 provides insights based on an examination of \nthe digital transformation strategies planned over the next 12 months by \na range of businesses and enterprise organizations. Most findings support \nearlier research, while some statistics were surprising. Chief among them, \nsecurity concerns are stopping 55 percent of organizations from committing \nto a digital transformation project. \n\nThe SoftServe Digital Transformation Report is based on a recent survey \ncompleted by 300 respondents, made up of 100 UK and 200 US decision-\nmakers. One hundred and fifty participants represented companies with \n1,000 to 3,000 employees, while the remaining participants represented \ncompanies with more than 3,000 employees. Respondents were \nbroken down into six key industries: business and professional services; \nmanufacturing; financial services; retail; distribution and transport; and other \ncommercial sectors. \n\nConducted in November 2016, the research asked a cross-industry panel of \nindustry leaders about the risks, challenges, and opportunities surrounding \ndigital transformation for modern businesses. \n\n\n\nsurvey report\n\nTHE SOFTSERVE DIGITAL TRANSFORMATION REPORT 2017 3\n\nThe Digital \nTransformation Landscape\nBuild understanding to drive implementation\n\nAwareness of digital transformation and the benefits that it \n\ndelivers are high across all verticals. However, the landscape \n\nis fragmented in terms of who has ultimate responsibility for \n\ndigital transformation strategies and where the true value lies. \n\nAll this uncertainty could account for the relatively low levels \n\nof complete adoption.\n\nAccording to IDC, the percentage of enterprises creating advanced digital \ntransformation initiatives will more than double by 2020, from 22 percent \nin 2015 to almost 50 percent by 20201 . While Gartner expects CIOs \nare typically already spending 18 percent of their budget in support of \ndigitalization, that figure is set to increase to 28 percent by 20182.\n\nIndeed, just one percent of organizations surveyed by SoftServe were \nunable to provide any kind of definition when asked: \u201cWhat does the term \n\u2018digital transformation\u2019 mean to you?\u201d\n\nOn the surface then it looks like digital transformation is well underway \neverywhere. When asked: \u201cTo what extent has a digital transformation \nstrategy been implemented in your business?\u201d just two percent of \nrespondents said they did not have a strategy and had no future plans to \nimplement one.\n\nA total of 27 percent of businesses claimed to have implanted a digital \ntransformation strategy across their entire organization. This figure seems \nhealthy at first glance. However, if we dig into the data, we find some big \ndifferences in adoption level - particularly across different regions.\n\n1.

But in the UK that figure is just 10 percent.\nThe difference between the levels of adoption in the \nUS and UK likely speaks to regulatory and cultural \ndifferences between the two counties.\n\nStarting a business in the US comes with significantly \nless red tape than in the UK. New businesses are \nmore likely to use disruptive technologies. They \nare not burdened by legacy solutions or opinions. \nIn order to keep pace with start-ups, established \nbusinesses in the US are more likely to turn to \ntransformative solutions.\n\nThings are a little different in the UK. With fewer \nstart-ups chipping away at the establishment, \nbusinesses are less inclined to adopt transformative \ntechnologies or practices. \n\nWhen it comes to digital transformation, \ncompetition drives innovation.\n\nIn the US, the number \n\nof organizations \n\nthat claim to have \n\nadopted complete \n\ntransformation \n\nstands at 33 percent. \n\nIn the UK, that figure \n\nis just 10 percent.\n\n25\n+2+27+46+M\n\n25 % 27 %\n\n46 %\n\nTo what extent has a digital \ntransformation strategy been \nimplemented in your organization?\n\nWe have one implemented across \nour whole organization\n\nWe have one implemented \nacross parts of our organization\n\nWe do not have one, but we are \nplanning to\n\nWe do not have one and have \nno plans to implement one\n\n\n\nsurvey report\n\nTHE SOFTSERVE DIGITAL TRANSFORMATION REPORT 2017 5\n\nIf we look across verticals, \u2018retail, distribution and \ntransport\u2019 leads the way in terms of complete \nadoption with 38 percent of businesses in \nthis sector claiming to have adopted digital \ntransformation across the whole organization - \nwhile just 18 percent of manufacturers claimed \ncomplete adoption.\n\nThe reason manufacturers find themselves behind \nthe curve when it comes to adopting digital \ntransformation may come down to a lack of agility. \n\nCompanies operating in the manufacturing sector \nare heavily siloed and have relatively high capital \nand operating expenses compared with businesses \nworking across retail, distribution, and transport. \nManufacturing is, therefore, a lot less agile than \nmore software-centric verticals such as financial \nservices or IT - which stand at 25 and 30 percent \nrespectively. Rather than transform, manufacturing \nis more likely to offshore work to regions that enjoy \nlower overheads.\n\nThe business and professional services vertical \nreports that 22 percent of organizations have \nadopted digital transformation across the board. \nThis vertical is reliant in human capital. With \nincremental improvements in artificial intelligence \nwe can expect to see this sector increasingly turning \nto digital solutions.\n\n\n\nsurvey report\n\nTHE SOFTSERVE DIGITAL TRANSFORMATION REPORT 2017 6\n\nPiecemeal adoption\n\nThe headline figures relating to complete adoption \ntell only half the story. The fact that nearly 50 \npercent of respondents have implemented \ntransformation across parts of their business shines \na light on the piecemeal approach that many are \ntaking.\n\nIt has parallels with the \u201cbring your own device\u201d \ntrend that shaped the enterprise mobility space \nin the years that followed the advent of the \nsmartphone. Individuals or smaller business units \nare more agile than entire organizations, it makes \nsense then that parts of the business will start to \nadopt disruptive technologies before the business \nat large.\n\nAs individuals or smaller parts of the business enjoy \nthe benefits delivered by digital transformation, we \ncan expect to see it being more widely adopted. In \nthis way, we\u2019ll see transformation happening from \nthe bottom up (or from the inside out) rather than \nthe more traditional command and control method. \nBut this approach runs the risk of becoming \nchaotic or haphazard. Ultimately, someone in \nthe organization needs to take responsibility. So \nwho will businesses turn to in order to make that \ntransition a success?\n\nThe fact that \n\nnearly 50 percent \n\nof respondents \n\nhave implemented \n\ntransformation across \n\nparts of their business \n\nshines a light on the \n\npiecemeal approach \n\nthat many are taking.\n\n\n\nsurvey report\n\nTHE SOFTSERVE DIGITAL TRANSFORMATION REPORT 2017 7\n\nCall in the experts\n\nMost businesses, it seems, are very inward looking when it comes to digital \ntransformation.\n\nWhen asked: \u201cWhen planning a digital transformation strategy in your \norganization, which resources do you/would you turn to for guidance and \nadvice?\u201d 76 percent of respondents stated that they would seek advice \nfrom experts within their business.\n\n28+28+20+13+6+5+M\n28.2 %\n\n27.9 %19.9 %\n\n13 %\n\n6 %\n5 %\n\nWhen planning a digital transformation strategy in your organization, \nwhich resources do you/would you turn to for guidance and advice?\n\nInternal IT expertise\n\nInternal IT and management expertise\n\nInternal management expertise\n\nIndustry analysts\n\nVendors\n\nMedia articles\n\nIn some ways, this makes perfect sense. These are the professionals \nwho know the business best, are familiar with the IT eco-system, the \noperational requirements and limitations of the business, and the people \nwho rely on the systems.\n\nAnd serving the people should not be overlooked as a consideration \nwhen it comes to digital transformation. You can probably count on the \nfingers of one hand the number of times a transformative IT infrastructure \nproject has been implemented where the employees have welcomed the \n\n\n\nsurvey report\n\nTHE SOFTSERVE DIGITAL TRANSFORMATION REPORT 2017 8\n\ndisruption and changes it brings. There is an almost \ninherent inertia among human beings when it \ncomes to change.\n\nThis touches on why so few businesses are adopting \ncomplete digital transformation. The people who are \narguably in the best position to drive transformation \nare not necessarily the people who ultimately benefit. \nIT doesn\u2019t just need to keep the ship afloat; it also \nneeds to keep it moving forward at full steam. More \noften than not, that results in businesses taking the \napproach that if things are not broken, they do not \nneed to be fixed. This is especially true at times of \neconomic hardship. Even now, the global economy \nis only just showing signs of recovery and IT budgets \nare set to stay flat in 20173 .\n\nSolutions, not products\n\nJust six percent of respondents felt that vendors \nwould be the best people to speak with for guidance \nor advice about digital transformation. This doesn\u2019t \nmean that people don\u2019t trust vendors; rather, it \nmeans they trust their internal experts more. That \nsaid, consumer trust in brands is at an all-time low4. \nThe fact that respondents trust vendors over the \nmedia speaks volumes.\n\nInternal stakeholders, while trusted, will however \nneed to turn to someone for advice. Those third \nparties are much more likely to be organizations that \nare not selling products in the space. Industry analysts \nand consultants that can help develop a solutions \nframework are well-placed to fill the knowledge void \nthat internal stakeholders might have.\n\nJust six percent of \n\nrespondents felt that \n\nvendors would be the \n\nbest people to speak \n\nwith for guidance or \n\nadvice about digital \n\ntransformation.\n\n3.

So, it is with good reason that \norganizations cite security as the number one challenge. In fact, security \n\n\n\nsurvey report\n\nTHE SOFTSERVE DIGITAL TRANSFORMATION REPORT 2017 11\n\nconcerns are stopping 55 percent of organizations \nfrom committing to a digital transformation project.\n\nSecurity will always be a key consideration with any \nnew IT initiatives, in fact it should be \u201cbaked in.\u201d \nIf there is any doubt about a company\u2019s existing \nsecurity strategy, then they should address that \nnow. The fact that digital transformation is not \nalways being carried out as part of an overall \nstrategy is a worry for the security conscious. Of \ncourse security, like everything else, is linked to \nbudgetary considerations.\n\nSo it is little wonder that budget is also viewed as a \nmajor challenge that businesses need to address. \nUnfortunately, as noted, IT budgets are not on the \nrise. Perhaps then, rather than positioning digital \ntransformation as an IT challenge, it should be \nconsidered a business objective, with budget set \naside accordingly.\n\nSecurity and \n\nbudgetary constraints \n\nare the two \n\nmain challenges \n\norganizations must \n\naddress to take \n\nadvantage of digital \n\ntrends.\n\nWhat challenges are impeding your organization from taking \nadvantage of digital trends?\n\nSecurity concerns\n\nBudget constraints\n\nLack of a strategy across the organization\n\nLack of required skills\n\nCompeting interests\n\nLack of willingness to take risks\n\nOrganizational inflexibility\n\nNot a collaborative culture\n\nLack of strong business case\n\nThere are no challenges\n\n0 %\n\n55\n\n50\n\n31\n\n27\n\n26\n\n22\n\n22\n\n11\n\n11\n\n4\n\n10 %% of respondents 20 % 30 % 40 % 50 % 60 %\n\n\n\nsurvey report\n\nTHE SOFTSERVE DIGITAL TRANSFORMATION REPORT 2017 12\n\nConclusion\n\nThe findings of the SoftServe Digital Transformation Report demonstrate \nthat while awareness of the need for, and an appreciation about the \nadvantages of, transformative technologies are high, levels of total \nadoption are relatively low.\n\nThe key to driving greater levels of implementation lies in transforming \nawareness into understanding.

Following the 1st industrial revolu-\ntion, the speed of change increased and has \nnever slowed down. For example: the aver-\nage corporate tenure in the Fortune 500 list \ndropped from 33 years in 1964 to 24 years in \n2016 and is forecasted to decrease by half to \n12 years by 2027.\n\nAccelerating this process are startups that \ndisrupt industries by inventing new busi-\nness models that deliver improved value to \ncustomer with greater experience, efficien-\ncy, and agility. Consequently, the future for \nlaggard companies is grim. Business leaders \n\nmust change legacy paradigms to survive \nand thrive in the new economy that is vola-\ntile, unpredictable, complex and ambiguous. \n\nBut despite the disruptive uncertainty that \nstems from an ever-changing marketplace,  \nthere is a long-standing vocation that thrives \nin this type of environment: military. Why? \nBecausethe military is built for warfare and \nprovides valuable strategies for today\u2019s con-\nstant battle for corporate efficiency, profit-\nability, and security.\n\nOne military strategist in particular worth \nconsidering is John Boyd.\n\nhttps://www.innosight.com/insight/creative-destruction/\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volatility,_uncertainty,_complexity_and_ambiguity\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volatility,_uncertainty,_complexity_and_ambiguity\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Boyd_(actor)\n\n\nwhitepaper DevOps: Strategies from a Fighter Pilot 3\n\nColonel John Boyd was a Korean War Unit-\ned States Air Force (USAF) fighter pilot \n\nwho flew F-86 Sabers against Soviet-made \nMig-15s in the first ever jet vs jet aerial war-\nfare. The F-86 jets were not as agile or pow-\nerful as their Mig-15 counterparts but were \nmore stable and were better equipped for \ntargeting at high-speeds. These dogfight ex-\nperiences equipped John Boyd with great in-\nsights, and experience-driven theories.\n\nHe returned from war to train other pilots as \nthe academic head and combat tactics au-\nthor for the USAF Weapons School. He also \ninspired the Lightweight Fighter Program \n\n(LWF) that led to the production of the more \npowerful and agile F-16 Falcon and F-18 \nHornet aircraft still in use by global military \npowers today. \n\nLater in his career, Boyd became a US Pen-\ntagon consultant and a thought leader for \nconflict strategies that are applicable in \nboth wartime and business. To this day, his \ntheories are highly influential in military, \nbusiness, sports, and legal litigation. Among \nother monikers, John Boyd was known as \n\u201cGenghis John\u201d for how he passionately \ncommunicated his convictions.\n\n\u201cGENGHIS JOHN\u201d\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Boyd_(actor)\nhttps://nationalinterest.org/feature/cold-war-battle-the-sky-f-86-saber-vs-mig-15-12909\nhttps://nationalinterest.org/feature/cold-war-battle-the-sky-f-86-saber-vs-mig-15-12909\n\n\nwhitepaper DevOps: Strategies from a Fighter Pilot 4\n\nOODA\n\nJohn Boyd also authored the concept of \nthe Observe-Orient-Decide-Act (OODA) \n\nloop. Despite a popular misconception, \nthe OODA loop is not about rapidly cycling \nthrough sequential phases to out-maneuver \nopponents with more decisions. The true \n\npower of OODA lies in embracing uncertain-\nty and disorder to improve agility and em-\npower initiative. \n\nThe \"loop\" that Boyd authored is depicted \nlike this:\n\nOBSERVE\n\nSimultaneously with the Orient phase, \ncompanies must continuously optimize \n\nstandard operations. This is expressed by \nthe \"Implicit guidance and control\" link be-\ntween \"Orient\" and \"Act\" phases. It also in-\n\ncludes maintaining optimal awareness on \nunfolding circumstances, outside informa-\ntion (data), and unfolding environmental in-\nteractions\u2014all of which contribute to intelli-\ngent observations. \n\nORIENT ACTDECIDE\nImplicit\nguidance\n& controlUnfolding\n\ncircumstances\n\nOutside\ninformation\n\nUnfolding\ninteraction with\nenvironment\n\nUnfolding\ninteraction with\nenvironment\n\nOBSERVE\nImplicit\nguidance\n& control\n\nObservations\nDecision\n\n(hypothesis)\n\nCultural\ntraditions\n\nGenetic\nheritage\n\nNew\ninformation\n\nPrevious\nexperiences\n\nAnalysis &\nsynthesis\n\nAction\n(test)\n\nFeed\n\nForward\n\nFeed\n\nForward\n\nFeed\n\nForward\n\nFeedback\n\nORIENT\n\nThe orienting phase is central and encom-\npasses multiple smaller nested activities, \n\nsuch as analysis, synthesis, and reflection on \nprevious experience. In this step, the com-\npany gains an accurate view of the situation \nat hand. In a business context, this means \ndeeply understanding customers, markets, \ncompetitors, and technology. \n\nBoyd emphasized that situational awareness \nshould be implicit, common, and all-inclu-\nsive. From executives down to line workers, \nall should share the same vision. As a result, \nthe company is better positioned to identify \nand exploit opportunities while establishing \ncompetitive differentiation.\n\n\n\nwhitepaper DevOps: Strategies from a Fighter Pilot 5\n\nSPEED\n\nBoyd emphasized that\u2014while detrimental \nin certain instances\u2014speed of execution \n\nis vital in decisive moments. Issuing explicit \nexecutive orders at a decisive moment caus-\nes frictions and takes time. This is why im-\nplicit understanding and a common, corpo-\n\nrate-wide vision are imperatives. Adherence \nensures that executive orders are proactive-\nly communicated so that stakeholders are \nentrusted to execute based on training and \njudgment.\n\nMODERN RELEVANCE\n\nBoyd left little practical advice on how one \nshould implement his OODA framework \n\nwithin a modern company. While the tenets \nof Boyd\u2019s strategies remain perpetually rele-\nvant, his theories were formulated decades \nago, and much has changed in the way busi-\nness is done.\n\nToday, all of the activities promoted by Boyd \nare enabled by (and executed through) com-\nputer systems. Companies observe the \nworld via data streams. Orientation can be \ndone with the help of voluminous data, met-\nrics, data analytics, and machine learning \nalgorithms. Decision makers are now sup-\nported by predictive analytics. Constant op-\ntimization is done via prescriptive analysis. \nEven the common vision can be facilitated \nby data sharing. \n\nYet most companies fail to optimally use the \ninformation in hand. \n\nBrands adopt traditional approaches to IT \nin order to reach \"alignment\" with business \nstrategies\u2014but these change perpetual-\nly, and legacy IT cannot keep pace with the \nspeed of digital demand. Corporate-wide \nunderstanding and shared implicit vision is \nvirtually nonexistent, and hierarchies leave \nlittle room for mutual trust between depart-\nments.\n\nInformation systems, that could yield valu-\nable information to the Orient phase are \noften fragmented and limited to function-\nal silos. Data collected in data warehouses \nare mostly descriptive in nature and often \ncontradictory. Continuous improvement in \nsystems and services is not feasible because \nof the separation of development and oper-\national teams. This disconnect also stands in \nthe way of continuous, incremental releases \nwhile breaking feedback loops.\n\nDECIDE AND ACT\n\nWhen the Orient phase yields new op-\nportunity, the \"Decide\"-\"Act\" process \n\nis initiated. A hypothesis is formulated (De-\ncide phase), and is tested against reality (Act \nphase). In a business context, this means \nunderstanding consumer demand and de-\nlighting customers with offerings and expe-\nriences. If the experiment is successful and \ncustomers are indeed delighted, the brand \n\nadopts, optimizes, and scales this new way \nof serving customers. Even if not successful, \nthe company still benefits by updating its \norientation against the real world.\n\nIf the OODA process sounds familiar, it \nshould. One can easily correlate the Orient, \nDecide, and Act cycles to the Build - Measure \n- Learn from Lean Startup cycle.\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lean_startup\n\n\nwhitepaper DevOps: Strategies from a Fighter Pilot 6\n\nIn 2009 Flickr employees delivered a pre-\nsentation about Dev and Ops cooperation, \n\nthat fostered fundamental changes in ways \ncompanies build and operate their com-\nputer systems. The movement was named \n\"DevOps\" and this year it celebrates its 10th \nanniversary. \n\nJohn Boyd should also be celebrated for his \nfundamental concepts that likely influenced \n\nthe DevOps movement. DevOps is built on \n3 pillars: culture, process, and technology. \nBoyd's priorities were surprisingly similar: \npeople, ideas, and hardware\u2014in that order.\n\nThere are many components of the modern \nDevOps movement that were clearly shaped \nby Boyd\u2019s influences, including:\n\nHIGH PERFORMING IT ORGANIZATION\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdOe18KhtT4\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdOe18KhtT4\n\n\nwhitepaper DevOps: Strategies from a Fighter Pilot 7\n\nCOMMON CULTURE  \nAND GOALS\n\nDevOps breaks silos between IT depart-\nments, primary development, oper-\n\nations, and IT project management. This \ncreates and fosters a sense of trust, exper-\nimentation, and cooperation between indi-\nviduals. One can directly relate this to Boyd's \nconcepts of \"Fingerspitzengefuhl\" and \"Ein-\nheit\".\n\nThrough DevOps, companies evaluate \nwhere to re-envision and optimize pro-\n\ncesses. The focus is placed on delivering \nvalue\u2014not blindly following a designated IT \nframework. Risk reduction is also achieved \nby delivering smaller batches, automated \ntesting, and reducing the potential for hu-\nman error. All of which is related to Boyd\u2019s \nconcepts of \"Schwerpunkt\" and \"Auftrag-\nstaktik\".\n\nAutomating and reducing manual efforts \nin the deployment process is a corner-\n\nstone of DevOps because it frees internal \ntalent to focus on value-adding activities. \nExamples include: optimizing diversity in \ntools and platforms, investing in specialized \ntools, automatic infrastructure provisioning, \nand automatic testing. As a result, the speed \nof deployment, and predictable results are \nachieved. This pillar of DevOps can be di-\nrectly related to \"Implicit guidance and con-\ntrol\" and speed of execution evangelized by \nBoyd.\n\nTHE PROCESS OF  \nCONTINUOUS DELIVERY\n\nTECHNOLOGY  \nAND AUTOMATION\n\n\n\nwhitepaper DevOps: Strategies from a Fighter Pilot 8\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nDevOps adoption is accelerating, and lead-\ning organizations are already reaping it \n\nrewards. There is no better time to leverage \nDevOps, and no time to waste. Without con-\ntinuous delivery companies cannot respond \nswiftly to customer demand and lagging \ncompanies are at a disadvantage against \nmore agile competitors. Manual deploy-\nments are error-prone and often fail at the \nworst possible times. Continuous improve-\nments of existing customer services are \nmuch harder to execute without DevOps. \n\nAccording to Boyd, a company is never \n\"done\" with the OODA loop while perpetu-\nally orienting and optimizing. It is an ongo-\ning fight for relevance and one that requires \nstrategies and tactics that are battle tested. \nSoftServe shares the same opinion regard-\ning digital transformation: it's not a one-off, \nit's about the journey.\n\nThink big and start small.

There are \nmultiple ways to represent 3D information: \npoint cloud, voxel grid, mesh, and functions.\n\nIn this whitepaper, we\u2019ll focus on point cloud \nwhich is the base type to represent sensor \ndata like LIDAR (light detection and ranging), \n\nToF (Time-of-Flight), structured light system, \nand many others.\n\nPoint clouds provide in-depth information \nwithout data simplification\u2014unlike voxel \ngrids, meshes, or a function representation \nthat are hard to estimate for complex objects. \nThe primary drawbacks of point cloud are \nsparsity of 3D space and unstructured data\u2014\nwhich we will also address.\n\nPoint cloud Voxel grid Mesh\n\n\n\nwhitepaper Point Cloud in a World of Deep Learning 3\n\nNEURAL NETWORKS FOR \nPOINT CLOUD\n\nNeural networks perform effectively \nin different domains. However, in the \n\ncomputer vision field, neural networks treat \nstructured data like images. To apply neural \nnetworks to point clouds, other approaches \nand techniques should be developed. They \ndiffer from standard convolutional neural \nnetworks. \n\nWith some tweaks, neural networks can be \nused to solve the following tasks on point \nclouds, including but not limited to:\n\n\u2022\t Classification\u2014detect a type of the \npoint cloud\n\n\u2022 Segmentation\u2014split a point cloud to \nsemantic parts\n\n\u2022 Completion\u2014fill\tmissing\tvalues\tin\ta\t\npoint cloud\n\n\u2022 Reconstruction\u2014generate a point cloud \nfrom a single or multiple 2D images\n\n\u2022 Registration\u2014stitch parts of the object \ninto a single one\n\n\n\nwhitepaper Point Cloud in a World of Deep Learning 4\n\nPOINTNET/POINTNET++\n\nWorking with point clouds requires the \nuse of symmetric functions (e.g. invari-\n\nant to order of the arguments). Simple opera-\ntions on scalars\u2014like addition and multiplica-\ntion\u2014are a simple example of such functions. \nFully connected networks are based on these \nsimple operations.\n\nThe first approach utilizing the idea of sym-\nmetric functions was presented by Charles R. \nQi et al. in PointNet: Deep Learning on Point \nSets for 3D Classification and Segmentation. \nTheir idea was to use a pair of multilayer per-\nceptrons\u2014combined with the input transfor-\nmation and feature transformation block\u2014to \nextract a set of features from point clouds.\n\nInput and feature transformation blocks are \nrequired to preserve transformation invari-\nance of the neural network. These small \nsubnetworks learn transformation matrices \nwhich can be used to transform point clouds \nto the canonical form in 3D and feature \nspaces accordingly.\n\nThis network can be adopted effectively in \nany type of task. \n\nPointNet++ is the extension of the classical \nPointNet and is based on Charles. R. Qi et al. \nadded sampling and grouping layers to the \nneural network. It allowed them to learn local \nfeatures of the point cloud by applying Point-\nNet to the groups of point clouds. This helps \nmanaging point clouds with variable densities.\n\nhttps://arxiv.org/abs/1612.00593\nhttps://arxiv.org/abs/1612.00593\n\n\nwhitepaper Point Cloud in a World of Deep Learning 5\n\nPointNet++ architecture from http://stanford.edu/~rqi/pointnet2/\n\nPointNet architecture from http://stanford.edu/~rqi/pointnet/\n\nhttp://stanford.edu/~rqi/pointnet2/\nhttp://stanford.edu/~rqi/pointnet/\n\n\nwhitepaper Point Cloud in a World of Deep Learning 6\n\n2D AND 3D \nCONVOLUTIONS\n\nConvolutional neural networks show \nincredible performance in various image \n\ntasks. It should be noted, however, that point \nclouds can\u2019t be directly processed by classic \nCNN.\n\nThere are two convolution approaches for \nmanaging point clouds.\n\n1. Generate a set of 2D images obtained \nfrom\tdifferent\tviews.\t2D\timages\tare\t\nrendered from all sides. This patch \nof images then proceeds together \nthrough a regular CNN to generate a \nfeature set which can then be used to \npredict the type of the point cloud. For \nexample, take a look at the Multi-view \nConvolutional Neural Networks for 3D \nShape Recognition paper.\n\n2. Use 3D convolution operation or their \nanalog. Various approaches were made \nto extend convolution to point clouds. \nTo learn more, read the following \n\n publications ELF-Nets: Deep Learning \non Point Clouds Using Extended \nLaplacian Filter and PointConv: Deep \nConvolutional Networks on 3D Point \nClouds. In these works, the authors \nsuggested new types of layers based on \nconvolution: \n\na.\t The\tfirst\tone\tis\tbased\ton\tthe\t2D\tdiscrete\t\nLaplace operator. ELF employs two \nmatrices: one for a center point and \nanother for its neighboring points. \nThe second matrix is scaled using a \nweighting function which is determined \nby\tthe\tlocal\tconfiguration\tof\tthe\t\nneighborhood.\n\nb. The second algorithm is based on \nPointConv, which is an extension to the \nMonte Carlo approximation of the 3D \ncontinuous convolution operator. For \neach\tconvolutional\tfilter,\tit\tuses\tMLP\tto\t\napproximate a weight function, then \napplies a density scale to re-weight the \nlearned weight functions.\n\nhttps://www.cv-foundation.org/openaccess/content_iccv_2015/papers/Su_Multi-View_Convolutional_Neural_ICCV_2015_paper.pdf\nhttps://www.cv-foundation.org/openaccess/content_iccv_2015/papers/Su_Multi-View_Convolutional_Neural_ICCV_2015_paper.pdf\nhttps://www.cv-foundation.org/openaccess/content_iccv_2015/papers/Su_Multi-View_Convolutional_Neural_ICCV_2015_paper.pdf\nhttps://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8884200\nhttps://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8884200\nhttps://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8884200\nhttps://arxiv.org/abs/1811.07246\nhttps://arxiv.org/abs/1811.07246\nhttps://arxiv.org/abs/1811.07246\n\n\nwhitepaper Point Cloud in a World of Deep Learning 7\n\nMulti-view CNN architecture from https://www.cv-foundation.org/openaccess/content_\niccv_2015/papers/Su_Multi-View_Convolutional_Neural_ICCV_2015_paper.pdf\n\nhttps://www.cv-foundation.org/openaccess/content_iccv_2015/papers/Su_Multi-View_Convolutional_Neural_ICCV_2015_paper.pdf\nhttps://www.cv-foundation.org/openaccess/content_iccv_2015/papers/Su_Multi-View_Convolutional_Neural_ICCV_2015_paper.pdf\n\n\nwhitepaper Point Cloud in a World of Deep Learning 8\n\nExample of Graph convolution operation from https://arxiv.org/\npdf/1801.07829.pdf\n\nGRAPH CNN\n\nA point cloud can be presented in mul-\ntiple ways with the help of graphs. For \n\ninstance, the whole point cloud can be pre-\nsented as one unstructured graph. Then, dif-\nferent types of graph NN are applied to the \npoint cloud. For example, Y. Zhang and M. \nRabbat, authors of Dynamic Graph CNN for \n\nLearning on Point Clouds, used a Graph CNN \nfor point cloud classification. This approach \nensures robustness to rotation invariance.\n\nIt is also possible to represent point clouds \nas a set of local neighborhood graphs. Then, \noperations similar to convolution on several \nlocal graphs are applied to extract features. \n\nhttps://arxiv.org/pdf/1801.07829.pdf\nhttps://arxiv.org/pdf/1801.07829.pdf\nhttps://arxiv.org/pdf/1801.07829.pdf\nhttps://arxiv.org/pdf/1801.07829.pdf\n\n\nwhitepaper Point Cloud in a World of Deep Learning 9\n\n3D Point Capsule Networks from https://arxiv.org/pdf/1812.10775.pdf\n\n3D POINT CAPSULE \nNETWORKS\n\nConvolutional neural networks have revolu-\ntionized many fields of computer vision by \n\nreaching superhuman levels of performance. \nWhile exploiting the core benefits of CNNs, \none should note existing drawbacks to this \napproach. \n\nAs argued by Geoffrey Hinton for many years, \nconvolutional neural networks do not con-\nsider the important spatial relations of simple \nand complex objects. This is a direct conse-\nquence of the translational and rotational \ninvariances of CNNs.\n\nCapsule network, proposed by J. Hinton, is a \ndeep learning building block that helps cap-\nture spatial hierarchies of the environment. \nExtracting important information from the \ndata enables the sample efficiency of capsule \nnetworks with respect to their CNN counter-\nparts.\n\nY. Zhao et al. propose 3D capsule networks to \nenable richer representation than a one-di-\nmensional latent embedding of common \npoint cloud autoencoders. The embedded \n\nlatent capsules trained with dynamic routing \nachieve top results in feature extraction, seg-\nmentation, 3D reconstruction, interpolation, \nand replacement.\n\nhttps://arxiv.org/pdf/1812.10775.pdf\nhttps://arxiv.org/pdf/1812.10775.pdf\n\n\nwhitepaper Point Cloud in a World of Deep Learning 10\n\nGANS AND \nAUTOENCODERS\n\nGenerative models could be used as a base \napproach to tackle not only the 3D recon-\n\nstruction task, but also the derivative ones, \nsuch as classification, for example. For the \nmoment, both methods are implemented in \ncombination with the PointNet architecture \nand the other tricks to get max performance.\n\nIn their work Learning Representations and \nGenerative Models for 3D Point Clouds, P. \nAchlioptas et al. showed that GAN can learn \na compact representation of the raw point \ncloud. This representation then can be used \nfor classification, completion, generation, and \nother tasks.\n\nAnother way of applying GANs is to use them \nfor point cloud upsampling. In the paper \nPU-GAN: a Point Cloud Upsampling Adversar-\nial Network by R. Li et al., a new architecture \nwas presented. This network fills tiny holes in \npoint cloud data and even fixes the position \nof noisy points.\n\nhttps://arxiv.org/abs/1707.02392\nhttps://arxiv.org/abs/1707.02392\nhttps://arxiv.org/abs/1907.10844\nhttps://arxiv.org/abs/1907.10844\n\n\nwhitepaper Point Cloud in a World of Deep Learning 11\n\nGenerator and discriminator of the PU-GAN architecture from        \nhttps://arxiv.org/pdf/1907.10844.pdf\n\nhttps://arxiv.org/pdf/1907.10844.pdf\n\n\nwhitepaper Point Cloud in a World of Deep Learning 12\n\nIN CONCLUSION\n\nWe have reviewed different neural net-\nwork architectures for point clouds.

Whether \na business sells clothes, pizza, or car rides, Harvard \nBusiness School confirms that leading digital \ncompanies generate better gross margins as well as \nbetter earnings and net income than organizations \nin the bottom quarter of digital adopters. \n\nNow, more than ever, customer experience, \nemployee experience, and user experience all add \nup to form an organization\u2019s brand. Businesses must \nthoughtfully design for every experience to succeed \nin a digital world where every touch point matters.\n\nFor many failing businesses, a fatal symptom is \na disconnect between providing a product and \ndelivering the service that comes with the digital \nterritory. User satisfaction is paramount to retaining \nbusiness but can be easily overlooked by those who \nexecute strategy without taking into consideration \n\nLeading digital \n\ncompanies generate \n\nbetter gross margins as \n\nwell as better earnings \n\nand net income than \n\norganizations in the \n\nbottom quarter of \n\ndigital adopters.\n\nSource: Harvard Business School\n\n\n\nwhitepaper\n\nHow Design THinking Can Transform Dying organizaTions 3\n\nthe needs of their users. However, there\u2019s no reason \nthat all businesses can\u2019t be successful, if they take \nthe time to put the proper strategy in place. \n\nDesign thinking goes beyond traditional business \nstrategies in that it encourages cross-disciplinary \nteams to immerse themselves in the lives of users: \nanalyzing their needs and goals, working iteratively \nto explore a variety of solutions, and ultimately \ndelivering a well-tested digital experience. \n\nDesign thinking refines user experience by putting \nthe user first, and tailoring the technology design \nto fit his or her needs. It\u2019s a strategy that allows \nfor a new perspective, giving even the most \npoorly performing organizations the chance to be \nrevamped into successful business models. It\u2019s a \nstrategy that begins and ends with users.\n\n\n\nwhitepaper\n\nHow Design THinking Can Transform Dying organizaTions 4\n\nDesign Thinking: Empathizing with the User\n\nThe first step in design thinking should always be to empathize, to \nresearch and deeply understand the emotional and psychological \nexperience that users have when interacting with a product or service. \n\nFor example, a specialty pharmacy called on SoftServe to help build a large \necosystem of digital products for patients, practitioners, and insurers. \nThe users for this platform were largely made up of terminally ill patients, \nrequiring a special approach. \n\nOur design research delved into the needs, fears, and frustrations \nthey have to cope with. This information allowed the teams building \nthe products to cultivate a strong empathy, as the patients\u2019 wellbeing \ndrove the shaping of the services. The end result was an application that \nprovided the tools for the patients to stay on track with their treatments, \ngiving short and easy questionnaires that encouraged and supported \nthem, and using special language to make it feel friendly without being \noverly cheerful. This success was enabled by the emotional connection to \nthe unique users.\n\nEmpathy begets strategy, and strategy begets success. With empathy \ndriving creative strategy, developers and designers need to consider \nwho the user is and, in doing so, the experience that awaits them. What \n\n\n\nwhitepaper\n\nHow Design THinking Can Transform Dying organizaTions 5\n\nis it that the user needs to accomplish? What blockers have previously \nstood in the way of this goal? What has been the previous experience? \nWhat changes need to be applied to the preexisting systems that have \nbeen put in place? This focus on empathy drives the design process by \nunderstanding the user\u2019s previous and current emotional experiences \nusing the company\u2019s technology and looking to create positive ones \nmoving forward. \n\nBusinesses can put the empathy of design thinking into action fairly \neasily by researching the user experience firsthand, emphasizing open \nlistening, and encouraging conversation. Immersing yourself in the user \nexperience enables the identification of problems that commonly occur, \ncreating a better understanding of how they can be addressed. Listening \nto the user\u2019s perspective ensures awareness of things that have been done \nbefore successfully, problems that they\u2019ve encountered along the way, \nand the different measures that can be put in place to prevent them. And \nlastly, conversation encourages the points of view of both the user and \nthe designers: boosting and clarifying the research that has already been \ngathered, strengthening relations through collaboration, and sharing in \nthe victory of a successful product.\n\nBy understanding the user\u2019s needs through sharing their perspective, \nbusinesses can then gain the power to unlock solutions that align user \nexperience and their own goals, encouraging innovative thinking and \ntransforming business strategy. Applying strategic empathy to the user \nexperience, businesses are better able to understand the markets that \nthey serve and ensure an exponentially higher chance of success.\n\nEmpathy begets strategy, \nand strategy begets success.\n\n\n\nwhitepaper\n\nHow Design THinking Can Transform Dying organizaTions 6\n\nDesign Doing: Make it. Break it. Repeat.\n\nThe second part of design thinking is putting thought to action through \n\u201cdesign doing.\u201d\n\nOnce a concept has been well researched and thought out with the user, \ntesting prototypes through trial and error is key. How will success be \nmeasured, what needs to be built to ensure that success, how can it be \nbuilt, and in what order? \n\nFor example, when SoftServe was approached by Overhaul, a logistics \nplatform for truck drivers and small shipping businesses, we were \nchallenged to create an online marketplace to fit their needs. It had to \nbe tailored to verified carriers and drivers as well as premium shippers: \ntracking freights, providing drivers with navigation, and encouraging them \nto follow security protocol. \n\nAfter we successfully tested the minimum viable product, we learned that \none of the problems that drivers were experiencing was vehicle theft after \nshipments reached their destination. In the final iteration of the product, \nour research and development team implemented a solution that involves \nsecuring each truck with BioLock, a SoftServe smart system that recognizes \n\n\n\nwhitepaper\n\nHow Design THinking Can Transform Dying organizaTions 7\n\nthe driver, impeding theft by blocking unknown \ndrivers from starting the vehicles. The cargo is \nsafeguarded and even has the added benefit of \ntracking the drivers\u2019 health. \n\nBuilding rapid prototypes and testing them on \nprospective users is paramount in uncovering the \nmost successful ways that the user\u2019s needs can \nbe met most effectively. You should also keep in \nmind the importance of applying different kinds \nof prototypes to different user demands. Which \nprototype fidelity works best for your company? \nLow fidelity prototyping might be a better option for \na business to quickly gain feedback on something \nmore conceptually vague. High fidelity prototyping \nmay be better for a concept that needs fine tuning \nin order to properly function effectively. \n\nWhatever the method: make it, break it, and repeat. \nTesting prototypes helps to test assumptions, and \nto eliminate unpredictability before the design faces \nthe public. Through implementing a design doing \n\u201ctest phase,\u201d businesses are better able to anticipate \nproblems that may arise and be proactive about \nseeking solutions without frustrating users.\n\nTesting prototypes \n\nhelps to test \n\nassumptions, \n\nand to eliminate \n\nunpredictability \n\nbefore the design \n\nfaces the public.\n\n\n\nwhitepaper\n\nHow Design THinking Can Transform Dying organizaTions 8\n\nDesign Culture: Collaboration is Key\n\nThe third aspect of fully implementing a design thinking strategy is to \ndefine your company\u2019s design culture. Design culture can be defined in \nseveral ways depending on the structure of your organization. It could be \na certain aesthetic, a certain process, a certain philosophical approach to \ndoing business that you are known for. But no matter how you choose to \ndefine your company\u2019s trademark design culture, the important thing is to \nmake it collaborative.\n\nIn the cases of both the specialty pharmacy and Overhaul, and in all \nexperience design initiatives, SoftServe\u2019s approach to serving users is first \nand foremost collaborative. According to a recent article from Computer \nWeekly, some of the best team structures are intentionally flat to reflect a \nmore collaborative attitude. By prioritizing collaboration, companies are \nable to execute new ideas and strategies in a way that\u2019s more creative \u2013 \nthey\u2019re also able to do it in a way that can match the rapid speed of the \ntechnology industry itself.\n\n\n\nwhitepaper\n\nHow Design THinking Can Transform Dying organizaTions 9\n\nAs much as the design thinking process revolves \naround user experience, it\u2019s impossible to execute \nwithout a strong collaborative base. In fact, a lack of \ncollaborative thinking can only spell certain death \nfor the future of your company. Design culture is \na creative one that lives and breathes through the \nmultidisciplinary teams that make it up. Through \nemploying a collaborative design culture, solutions \nare unveiled with speed and synergy. Through \ninclusivity and the sharing of ideas and strategies, \npeople working together can solve real life business \nchallenges quickly and efficiently.\n\nNo matter how you choose to \ndefine your company\u2019s trademark \ndesign culture, the important \nthing is to make it collaborative.\n\n\n\nwhitepaper\n\nHow Design THinking Can Transform Dying organizaTions 10\n\nAbout SoftServe\n\nWith over 20 years of experience in digital software development and \nconsulting, SoftServe is a global leader in solving complex business \nproblems, creating industry disrupting technology and accelerating growth \nand innovation while optimizing operational efficiency.

They trust that \nfintech companies are on the \nside of the little guy.\u201d  \n\nThe first step is to understand the \ntechnology trends currently driving \ndigital innovation in financial services. \nIn the following eBook, we discuss three \nwell-known fintech startups and key \ntakeaways from each of their stories. \n\n\n\n4\n\nWealthfront Enhances \nRobo-Investing with \nArtificial Intelligence \n\nWealthfront positions itself as a \ncheaper, more tech-reliant wealth-\nmanagement firm. Using a proprietary \nplatform featuring an intuitive user \nexperience and responsive, modern \ndesign, Wealthfront customers can \nmanage their money with the help \nof technology, instead of paying for \ninvestment advice that may or may not \noutperform the market. The company \nand its competitors are most known \nfor catering to digitally-savvy \u201cHENRYs,\u201d \nor \"High Earning, Not Rich Yet\" affluent \nmillennials.  \n\nHigh \n\nEarning \n\nNot \n\nRich \n\nYet\n\n\n\n5\n\nToday, Wealthfront manages about \n$4 billion for 90,000 investors, while \nits closest competitor Betterment has \nnearly $6 billion in AUM (assets under \nmanagement) and 188,000 clients. Both \npale in comparison to Vanguard Group's \nrobo-solution with $40 billion AUM and \nSchwab's at $10 billion. The industry as \na whole grew more than 200% in 2015, \naccording to a study by Aite Group.\n\nSo what sets Wealthfront apart from \nother players in this space? In March \n2016, former Wealthfront CEO Adam \nNash unveiled what he calls \u201cWealthfront \n3.0,\u201d the latest version of the platform \nthat leverages more sophisticated \nartificial intelligence (or AI) as well as the \nintegration of modern APIs. \n\n200 %\nrobo-advisor industry growth in 2015\n\nAITE GROUP\n\n\n\n6\n\nWealthfront is betting AI will have an \neven bigger impact on the financial \nservices industry than automated advice \nbased off user-generated data. In simple \nterms, AI is when a machine mimics \ncognitive human function like reasoning \nand problem solving. It calls on a wide \nvariety of domains and tools, including \ndata science, machine learning, and \nsearch optimization. \n\nIn addition to looking for fees, tax loss \nharvesting, and cash drag, Wealthfront\u2019s \nAI will track actual account activity and \nautomatically apply that behavior to the \nadvice Wealthfront delivers \u2013 without \nasking customers to field additional \nquestionnaires.\n\n\n\n7\n\nObserved behavior can\u2019t be fudged on the \nphone or lied about in person. \nMore importantly, observed behavior may \nreveal insights about ourselves that we aren\u2019t \neven consciously aware of.\n\nAt the time of the announcement, Nash told WealthManagement.com, \n\n\n\n8\n\nFor example, Wealthfront\u2019s new \nalgorithm will inform users if they \ndo not have enough cash in their \nemergency fund by tracking every \ntransaction a user makes. It will also \nhelp determine whether they are too \nheavy allocated in a specific stock by \nlooking at outside brokerages. \n\nWe are building our platform for the future. We have a huge opportunity to \ndeliver financial advice that\u2019s deeply personalized and relevant while getting \na platform in place for AI\u2019s increasing role.\n\nADAM NASH,\n\nCEO (2013-2016),\n\nWEALTHFRONT \n\n\n\n9\n\nExperts say traditional wealth-\nmanagement professionals should not \nfeel threatened by consumer interest \nin robo-investing, because many \nconsumers still lack the confidence or \nmotivation to manage money on their \nown. Instead, these platforms will allow \nwealth-management professionals \nto help serve clients and uncover \nadditional insights. \n\nWealthfront competitor Betterment \nrecently launched \u201cBetterment for \nAdvisors\u201d for this purpose. \n\nAs artificial intelligence becomes more \nsophisticated, the most successful \nfinancial institutions will embrace digital \ntransformation as a way to enhance \nrather than replace decision-making and \nimprove the customer experience. \n\nKEY \nTAKEAWAY\n\n\n\n10\n\nWePay Streamlines \nPayment Processing \nwith Open API\n\nWePay offers a payment processing \nsolution designed for platforms that \nfacilitate transactions between multiple \nparties, such as marketplaces like \nCare.com and crowdfunding sites like \nGoFundMe or CrowdRise. \n\n\n\n11\n\nToday WePay is a popular example of \ndigital disruption in fintech, but that \nwasn\u2019t always the case. As a two-year \nold startup in 2010, WePay founders \nearned a ton of publicity \u2013 and the \nindustry\u2019s attention \u2013 by dropping a \n600-pound block of ice  at the entrance \nof a conference for PayPal developers. \n\nDollar bills were encased inside the ice \nwith a message referencing a PayPal \nsnafu that involved freezing customer \naccounts. The marketing stunt was \ncovered by TechCrunch, and according \nto WePay, signups increased by 225%.  \n\n\n\n12\n\n0010\n0011\n0101\n\nWePay\u2019s offering is deployed using an \nopen API, which allows developers to \nintegrate its payment platform with \nalmost any service or product on many \nother platforms. APIs are standards that \nenable disparate software components \nto communicate and exchange \ninformation. \n\nAlthough APIs were originally used to \nlink software components within an \norganization, the internet has brought \nrise to the popularity of external or \npublic APIs, which permit third parties \nto access their data or services in a \ncontrolled environment.\n\n\n\n13\n\nWePay was one of the first few fintech \nstartups to use a public API, but more \ntraditional financial institutions have \nbeen wary of open APIs, believing \nan open system would challenge \nestablished business models.\n\nRetail bank customers, for example, \nare \u201chooked\u201d with checking and savings \naccounts and go on to use other financial \nservices such as loans, mortgages, \nsavings, foreign exchange and even online \naccess from their core account providers. \nConservative financial institutions worry \nthat by pulling back the curtain on their \ndigital investments, they will invite other \norganizations to benefit from their data. \n\nWhile that\u2019s technically true, organizations \nlike WePay, Google, Apple, and Facebook \nall use open APIs to allow third parties to \nadd functionality to their core offerings, \nessentially becoming a platform for \nthird party innovation. This offers many \nbenefits to the original organization. \nBesides driving revenue, it also allows the \norganization to better serve the needs of \nits customers. \n\n\n\n14\n\nIn another example, Fidor was founded \nas an online-only bank in Germany, \nand recently launched in the United \nKingdom. Fidor\u2019s strategy is to open \nup its APIs to developers to create \nimproved interfaces and apps for its \ncustomers. The company\u2019s business \nmodel relies on openness and \ncollaboration.  \n\nFidor developers are currently building \nan interface  that will allow every \naccount holder to tailor their banking \nexperience and multi-account APIs that \nwill ultimately lead to a \u201ctrusted partner\u201d \napp store. The company has gone a step \nfurther by starting an API developer \ncommunity, including developer days to \npromote the programmability of their \nbanking data.\n\n\n\n15\n\nTech giants like Facebook and Google \nand fintech disruptors like WePay and \nFidor believe that the key to success in \nthe digital era is a widely accepted and \neasily integrated platform.\n\nThey recognize that traditional business \nmodels are unsustainable in today\u2019s \nmarketplace, and they have chosen \n\nto prioritize the customer experience \nby supporting collaborative and third-\nparty innovation. \n\nFor the fintech industry as a whole, \naccess to a rich pool of shared data  from \nfinancial institutions will enable industry \ninnovators to develop a whole new range \nof digital products for their customers. \n\nKEY \nTAKEAWAY\n\n\n\n16\n\nCircle Champions the Development \nof Public Blockchains \n\nA peer-to-peer (P2P) payment platform, \nCircle enables users to bypass traditional \nintermediaries and instantly send and \nreceive money at the best exchange rate \navailable to consumers, with zero fees.\n\nUnlike competitors that operate with \nlimited currencies, Circle positions itself \nas a global solution with features like \n\u201ccross-border payments.\u201d\n\nCircle\u2019s technology relies on a blockhain, \nor a distributed digital ledger that allows \ncompanies to track the ownership of \nassets. Circle converts currency into \nbitcoins for transfer and then converts \nthe amount back to fiat currency once \nthe transfer is complete.\n\n\n\n17\n\nAs one of the earliest and highest-funded \nbitcoin startups, Circle was the first \ncompany to receive the state of New \nYork\u2019s first-ever BitLicense in November \n2015. In September 2016, Circle became \nthe first bitcoin platform to integrate \nwith Apple\u2019s iMessage,  a move that \nallows users to send bitcoin (as well as \ndollars and euros) through the popular \ntexting platform.\n\nToday, Circle has moved beyond its \nearlier contributions to bitcoin and \nis now a leading advocate for the \ndevelopment of public blockchains.  \n\n\n\n18\n\nIBM recently announced banks and \nother financial institutions are adopting \nblockchain technology \u201cdramatically \nfaster\u201d than expected, with 15% of top \nglobal banks intending to roll out full-\nscale commercial blockchain products \nin 2017. But traditionally conservative \nfinancial services companies are hesitant \nto pursue public blockchains over private \nblockchain solutions. \n\nWhy is this distinction important?\n\nof top global banks intend \nto roll out full-scale commercial \nblockchain products in 201715 %\n\nBANK\n\nIBM\n\n\n\n19\n\nPublic blockchains are accessible \nby anyone. They operate under the \nprinciple that because all participants \ncan see all account balances and \nthe movement of all transactions, \ncorruption and hacking can\u2019t go \nundetected. This method of security is \nrelatively new, but since the inception \nof bitcoin, which relies on a public \nblockchain, no one has found a way to \nbreak the system in a practical way.\n\nPrivate blockchains, on the other \nhand, are secured by more traditional \nmethods, like user permissions. Though \nthese methods may feel more secure \nsimply because they\u2019re more familiar, \nthere have been countless examples of \nsecurity breaches  on systems that use \nthis approach.\n\n\n\n20\n\nWe got excited about the idea of bitcoin and blockchain \n\nsimply because it enabled money to work the way the \n\nrest of the Internet does. We can share photos, share \n\nopinions, but we can\u2019t share money very easily. So bitcoin \n\nallows us to do that, without having to think too hard \n\nabout bitcoin or blockchain, just like the way we don\u2019t \n\nthink about HTTP when we look at the Web.\n\nIn an interview with Yahoo Finance, Circle co-founder Sean Neville said, \n\n\n\n21\n\nLike all technology that relies on \ntraditional security, private blockchain \ndevelopers will always have to \ninnovate to stay one step ahead of \nhackers. More significantly, private \nblockchain solutions are closed off \nfrom the rest of the world, which puts \ntheir owners at a disadvantage to \ncompanies like Circle that rely on a \nsystem that supports open innovation.  \n\u2003\n\n\n\n22\n\nLike innovation enabled by open APIs, public blockchains are \nnecessary for supporting increased collaboration in the financial \nservices industry. Public blockchains are also better equipped to \ncarry out global transactions. With industry pioneers like Circle \npushing for wide-spread adoption of public blockchains , they will \none day be the norm among fintech leaders.   \n\nKEY \nTAKEAWAY\n\n\n\nwww.softserveinc.com\n\nAbout SoftServe\n\nWith over 20 years of experience in digital software development and consulting, \nSoftServe is a global leader in solving complex business problems, creating industry \ndisrupting technology and accelerating growth and innovation while optimizing op-\nerational efficiency.

SoftServe received \na request to design and develop a centrally-managed and unified platform for their \nrisk management department. The system needed to coordinate diverse data-related \nactivities with the ability to group risks. The ultimate goal was to meet strategic data-\ndriven business objectives. \n\nThe client\u2019s leadership team wanted to achieve fully-informed operational excellence and \nbusiness intelligence with related goals in data governance, architecture, compliance, \nregulation, and business integration.\n\nProject Description\n\nIn order to deliver the project, SoftServe partnered with Cloudera. The central goal \nof the project was to design a new version of the product architecture. This included \nrevising technical decisions in the initial version and addressing quality attributes such as \nconfigurability, scalability, reliability, interoperability, extensibility, and testability. The client \nexpected the new system to be able to manage 260 billion original messages on a daily basis.\n\nSoftServe contributed to the solution\u2019s on-time delivery, supplied peak resources, and \noptimized development cost for the client.

MEDHOST\u2019s integrated product portfolio includes intuitive, Cloud-\nbased solutions, including YourCareEverywhere, a robust health and \nwellness consumer engagement platform. Their broad offering of hosting, \noutsourcing, marketing and consulting services are changing how clinicians \nand hospital leaders work and collaborate, while generating notable \noperational improvements. MEDHOST delivers value by enabling hospitals \nof all types and all sizes to better manage the business of healthcare across \nthe care continuum while meeting evolving regulatory requirements.\n\n\n\nBusiness Challenge\n\nWith more than 30 years of experience in the healthcare, MEDHOST has a long history of \ndeveloping and implementing innovative approaches to address the evolving needs of \nhealthcare professionals.\n\nThe customer experience is becoming an increasingly key differentiator for industry leaders, so \nMEDHOST set out to develop \u201cYourCareCommunity,\u201d a new solution aimed at automating and \nsimplifying patient and provider-related tasks and communication. The solution was designed \nto provide patients and their caregivers with online access to personal health records and \nrelated tools for easier and faster interaction with healthcare providers.\n\nProject Description\n\nMEDHOST partnered with SoftServe to build the YourCareCommunity platform using a micro \nservice architecture for the Cloud-based portal on AWS. This approach was chosen  \nto decrease time-to-market for new feature releases and efficiently divide the workload \nbetween engineering teams. AWS also made it possible to build a comprehensive consumer \nrelationship management solution with integrated multifaceted analytics based on a Cloud \ndata exchange platform.\n\nSoftServe and MEDHOST built YouCareCommunity\u2019s system architecture on Docker containers, \nwhich were chosen for their exceptional ability to scale and perform fast application \ndeployment. This decision also allowed SoftServe and MEDHOST to divide the application\u2019s \nbackend logic into independent parts and distribute their development among different teams.\n\nWithin the scope of this project, the joint technical team also implemented tools that enabled \nthe continuous integration server to build microservices and other system components on \nDocker containers and automatically publish them to internal development Docker registry \nand ECR on AWS. Afterwards, the configuration management tool was used for automation of \nDocker containers deployment into development environments.\n\nThe engineering team was using Docker-based microservices and innovative service registry \nand centralized configuration management instruments together with HAproxy for load \nbalancing. This helps ensure the reliable service discovery and routing mechanism. HA-proxy \nconfiguration is dynamically recreated and reloaded from configuration registry with minimal \ndowntime when the service registration state changes. This substantially increases the system \nstability and allows the developers to use agile dynamic infrastructure.\n\nFinally, Chef enables instance provisioning and manages configuration and service lifecycle \non production environments, including deployment of microservices and Docker containers. \nDuring the development process, engineers separated accounts for development and \nproduction within AWS and enabled communication between the units they used in VPC peer \nconnections. The following AWS services were used: EC2, VPC, ELB, Rote53, S3, IAM, RDS, ECR, \nElasticCache, CloudWatch, SQS, SNS, SES WorkDocs, Elastic Transcoder and WorkSpaces.\n\n2case study | MEDHOST Improves Patient-Provider Relationship with YourCareCommunity\n\n\n\nValue Delivered\n\nThe architecture suggested by SoftServe\u2019s experts reflects a modern approach to software \ndevelopment, deployment, and maintenance that enabled MEDHOST to be more agile and \nefficient in their development processes, cut development costs, and decrease time to market.\n \n\u201cI would describe working with SoftServe with one word \u2013 engaging.

This client had 3500+ employees and communication within the organization \nbecame complicated. The task to locate expertise could take anywhere from 6-8 hours to \nseveral working days. It required significant communication overhead and the quality of \nresults weren\u2019t always perfect. Mainly due to the fact that several systems that supported \ndaily company activities were scattered and disparate causing the information and expertise \nto be disconnected.\n\nEXPERTISE RETRIEVAL \nSYSTEM FOR A SOFTWARE \nDEVELOPMENT COMPANY\n\n\n\ncase study |    Expertise Retrieval System for a Software Development Company 2\n\nOur client needed a better way to locate corporate assets, such as knowledge, experience \nand information. They decided to partner with SoftServe due to the company\u2019s extensive \nexpertise in enterprise technology solutions. \n\nProject Description\n\nFinding an expert is a challenging task because it can be a loosely defined concept. One \nexample is finding a system to analyze and access \u201ctacit knowledge\u201d in organizations is \nthrough artifacts of \u201cexplicit knowledge\u201d (e.g., documents). Expertise evidence usually \ncomes from different heterogeneous sources. Not all sources are equally important or \nrelevant. There are two basic approaches to expert search:\n\n\u2022 Profile-based method              \u2022    Document-based method\n\nBoth have its pros and cons. For example, profiles tend to become outdated quickly or \nbe incomplete. Document-based methods need some time for a new person to appear \nin the list, usually until a significant amount of expertise evidence (e.g., documents) are \ngenerated. Due to the nature of available information and evidence the SoftServe team \ndecided to use a hybrid approach that combines the best of both methodologies.\n\nSoftServe\u2019s solution used SQL Server Data Warehouse and Integration Services to access, \ntransform, and clean the data collected from a number of internal systems. Then the \ndata is combined to form a single representation of the searched entity to be indexed by \nElasticSearch.\n\nThe system combines multiple data sources, including unstructured work products and \nstructured sources such as Enterprise Directory. The \u201cauthority\u201d of each expert in relation \nto an expertise is computed via the nature of the matched expertise \u201cevidences\u201d and their \nrelevance.\n\nThe system naturally captured employee activities and the results of those activities \nwithout the need to fill in forms or profiles that tend to become outdated quickly. Examples \nof artifacts that may be used as an evidence of employee expertise include:\n\n\u2022 External certifications\n\u2022 Training attended\n\u2022 Activities in projects\n\u2022 Content in collaboration tools (for example, wiki pages, office documents)\n\u2022 Publications on the internet\n\u2022 Professional social networks\n\u2022 Internal community activities (conferences, community gatherings)\n\u2022 Internal knowledge sharing activities\n\nThe application provides an interactive user interface, which can benefit any business user, \nwithout extensive training or an analytical background.\n\n\n\ncase study |    Expertise Retrieval System for a Software Development Company 3\n\nValue Delivered\n\nSoftServe\u2019s solution of corporate knowledge reuse helped our client gain competitive \nadvantage, maximize productivity and efficiency, as well as build a collaborative \nenvironment.\n\nKey solution\u2019s benefits:\n\n\u2022 Significant decrease in time to locate necessary experts (10x)\n\u2022 Quicker access to corporate knowledge and information\n\u2022 More agile decision-making supported by larger and more quantifiable information\n\u2022 Improved risk management\n\u2022 Increased employee and company efficiency\n\u2022 Faster response to challenges and opportunities\n\n\n\nABOUT US\nSoftServe is a digital authority that advises and provides at the \ncutting-edge of technology.

If companies don't act quickly to create and maintain value for \ncustomers across all touchpoints, a decline in market share is inevitable. As the pace of \ntechnology continues to accelerate, companies that fail to innovate will fall behind.\n\nSo how will companies of the future maintain relevance? How will they keep the customer\u2019s \nperspective central to their operations, ensuring value is always being created?\n\nAt SoftServe, we believe value stream thinking (VST)\u2014a classic concept, but more \nrelevant now than ever\u2014is essential to remain competitive in the digital economy.\n\nWhat is a value stream?\n\nPut simply, whenever a market demand exists, there is potential to create value. \n\nA value stream is comprised of the activities required to meet demand, or more \nspecifically, what it takes to create and deliver a valuable product or service to the \ncustomer. The concept reads simple enough, yet companies in today's complex \nlandscape continue to suffer from silos and hierarchies, primarily at a technology level, \nbut also at organizational levels. \n\nIn a world of fragmented attention spans, coupled with fierce competition for positive \nengagement and memorable experiences, many companies lose sight of their ultimate \ngoal: to provide value for the customer, on her terms.\n\n\n\nwhitepaper | Value Stream Thinking: DevOps and Beyond 3\n\nValue stream thinking in action\n\nWhat does it look like when VST is applied to software development?\n\nThe best examples are those that improve efficiency and eliminate waste, resulting in \nbetter communication and superior value propositions. Establishing a chain process in \nwhich value is added at each step is paramount\u2014while conversely, an inferior approach \ncan cause value to be lost rapidly. In software engineering, DevOps is a prime example \nof effectively applied value stream thinking.\n\nThe DevOps movement drives agile collaboration between two pillars of the software \ncreation process\u2014development and operations\u2014making their interaction seamless. DevOps \nprovides a combination of tools and practices that facilitate successful communication \nbetween these often-disparate teams, accelerating solution delivery, minimizing downtime, \nincreasing time to innovate, while minimizing complexity and reducing costs. \n\nDevOps also supports implementing changes incrementally throughout the entire \ndevelopment and testing process. The ability to retrieve feedback from the end-user \nand include requested changes in a timely fashion creates added value. Time is the most \nvaluable resource in the ever-accelerating software industry, and a difference of one week \nin delivery can be the difference between being an innovation leader or a laggard.\n\nLet\u2019s take a closer look at two case studies where value stream \nthinking was put into practice within healthcare and financial \nservices.\n\nValue stream thinking is useful in foreseeing the challenges faced by participants in \ntoday\u2019s healthcare ecosystems. From the inability to successfully share each other\u2019s data \nto processing delays, the healthcare industry is replete with easily identifiable instances \nof value opportunities missed, lost, or destroyed\u2014all contributing to rising costs. When \npatient data from exams, imaging, and wearable devices like pace trackers, blood pressure \nmeters, and smart scales are shared throughout the healthcare ecosystem, all members \nbenefit through the collaborative interconnectedness. \n\nValue stream thinking can be leveraged to improve outcome reporting as well. For example, \nOutcomes Based Healthcare (OBH) partnered with SoftServe to create a mobile solution \nthat dramatically improves patient reported outcomes (PRO) via continuous and passive \nsmart phone monitoring. The project was broken down into multiple phases including \ninvestigation, application architecture, development & user interface (UI), integration, and \ntesting. The app itself was built using an iterative \u2018agile scrum\u2019 methodology.\n\nhttps://outcomesbasedhealthcare.com/product/\n\n\nwhitepaper | Value Stream Thinking: DevOps and Beyond 4\n\nYet another example of value stream thinking in practice is within the financial services \nindustry and development of blockchain solutions. What if the objective was to build the \nworld\u2019s first invoice exchange platform to serve private investors, banks, and alternative \nfinancial bodies\u2014while speeding the turnover of capital by enabling the selling of assets \nbefore their maturity date? We delivered exactly that for our client by optimizing the use \nof distributed ledger technology (DLT) to augment invoice trading, while empowering \nanyone with the opportunity to easily trade invoices or other assets\u2014securely, \ntransparently, and simply.\n\nValue stream thinking as prevention\n\nImagine a retailer successfully grows its online presence. The company has thousands of \nloyal customers who enjoy the ease of making online purchases, frequent promotions, \nswift home delivery, high quality customer service, convenient product review \nsubmissions, and useful financing options.\n\nSuddenly, a cyberattack compromises customers\u2019 online payment data and disrupts \nthe company\u2019s entire value stream. The company\u2019s hard-earned reputation is damaged, \ncustomers are frustrated, and financial losses are inevitable. \n\nObviously, the hackers are to blame, but the real culprits are buried in the retailer\u2019s \nlegacy IT systems, which impeded the implementation of stronger security features. \nHad the retailer analyzed its supply chain from a value stream perspective, it may have \ndiscovered\u2014long before the attack occurred\u2014that vulnerabilities in the value stream were \naccidents waiting to happen.\n\n\n\nwhitepaper | Value Stream Thinking: DevOps and Beyond 5\n\nPrinciples of value stream thinking\n\nEvery industry has its own version of an ideal value stream. However, regardless of \nindustry, the core principles of applying value streams remain the same\u2014efficiency, the \nelimination of repetitive steps, simplification, interoperability between different parts in \nthe value creation chain, and adaptability to changes in the value stream. \n\nSuccessfully applying value stream thinking to an existing process includes mapping \neach step to visualize the connections between moving parts and to scrutinize how \nthey interact. This requires an openness across groups, and an open dialogue between \nthem, are essential to ultimately producing value for the customer through improved \nexperiences, and the removal of bottlenecks and friction.\n\nOf course, in an ideal world, value stream thinking and detailed technology discussions are \npresent from the beginning of the business or solution design process. After all, proactive \nthinking always wins against a reactive approach.\n\nThe effort to maximize value additions and minimize value losses creates a disciplined \nway of analyzing and improving complex processes, regardless of industry or sector. \nThese optimizations promote the universal objective of delivering the best possible value \nproposition to an end-user\u2014which is crucial in the new, just-in-time, digital economy.\n\n\n\nwhitepaper | Value Stream Thinking: DevOps and Beyond 6\n\nTechnology is the cornerstone\n\nEfficiency, the elimination of repetitive steps, simplification, interoperability, and \nadaptability to change must be present in order to achieve maximum value creation. \n\nCritical questions in value stream thinking include:\n\n\u2022 What can be done to optimize a process?\n\u2022 What can be added or eliminated to ensure that value is obvious and accessible to the\n\nend-user?\n\u2022 Does technology need to be changed?\n\u2022 Should personnel training be increased?\n\u2022 Can new value be unlocked by looking at data from a different angle?\n\nAt the business architecture level, technology needs to be imagined, shaped, and applied \nto protect and bring together value stream components. \n\nCompanies that learn to adapt and continually evolve to meet the changing demands of \nthe market will continue to thrive.

Technology is empowering sales teams to identify,\ntrack, and engage prospects more efficiently than ever. In order to maximize returns on\ncustomer acquisition investments, companies need to consider calculated adoption of\ndata-driven technology. And they need to do it today.\n\nClosing new business is clearly vital for every company, but what about those customers\nwho require no \u201chunting\u201d to reach? In the search for new revenue, loyal customers, brand\n\nThis white paper reviews:\n\n\u2022 Why likes, follows, and shares are not indicative of future success \n\u2022 The differences between a loyalist, advocate, and fanatic\n\u2022 How technology should be leveraged to convert existing customers into brand fanatics\n\nA like is not a like, is not a like \n\nIt is no small task for a company to earn a customer, but in today\u2019s society, consumers are\nincreasingly inclined to consider a \u201clike\u201d to be all the advocacy needed. To be successful,\nbrands need to deliver consistent, relevant engagements and genuine personalization that\ninspires actions beyond clicks.\n\nBrand Fanaticism 2.0 is brand advocacy driven by genuine personalization, powered by\ntechnology, and future-proofed by agility and innovation.\n\n\u2022 It is not grown through increased ad spend in the face of declining organic social reach\n\u2022 It is not overrun by the cost of digital advertising rising faster than inflation\n\u2022 It is a remedy to rising ad blocker usage and ad blindness\n\nPositive word-of-mouth recommendations are the most enduring marketing tool ever\ncreated. Recommendations from family, friends, and peers are still trusted by 92% of\nthe population today. The challenge is how to earn consumer loyalty and then refer\nyour brand to countless consumers in a saturated marketplace with declining consumer\ntrust and attention spans. The solution is a personalized engagement strategy that\ncreates a brand loyalist, converts him or her into an advocate, and ultimately into a vocal\nand active brand champion.\n\n\n\nwhitepaper | Why Today\u2019s Brands Need Fanatics Not Loyalists 3\n\nBut sustainable brand fanaticism requires solid fundamentals.\n\nMarket conditions and consumer paradigms are irrevocably changing the status quo. Without\noptimized brand, mobile, and integrated communications strategies, most companies have\nlittle chance of sustainable success. These are fundamental tenets, not innovations.\n\nTo effectively compete, brands must also:\n\nConsolidate silos and disparate data\nOptimal marketing today requires optimized first-, second-, and third-party data. If data\nlives in silos and isn\u2019t managed properly for quality and gaps then genuine \npersonalization is impossible. In the absence of personalization, marketing waste \n(dollars, time, effort) will follow.\n\nMigrate to the Cloud for agility\nMigration to the cloud is inevitable for any business serving customers beyond\nits neighborhood. Each business must determine whether public, private, or a hybrid cloud\nsolution is best, but migration is a must for the agility needed to keep pace with\ntechnological and personalization progress.\n\nProvide Relevant and frictionless experiences\nMost media managers would agree that experience is king in a world where the consumer\n\u2014not the brand\u2014dictates relevance and future sustainability. In fact, when a consumer is\ngiven a genuinely personalized experience she is 10 times more likely to be a brand\u2019s\nmost valuable customer, typically making more than 15 transactions in one year.\n\nMastering these fundamentals can generate likes, followers, and quality leads that equip \nsales and marketing teams to more effectively capture new prospects and revenue. Not \nevery customer will become a fan, and not every fan is guaranteed to remain one, but \nfundamentals do not guarantee fanaticism.\n\nLoyalty is dead \u2013 long live loyalty! \n\nIf you think brand loyalty is dead, think again. Generation X is more brand loyal than both \nBaby Boomers and Millennials, but Generation Y and Z are more open to loyalty programs \nif technology allows for the right personalization. \n\n#1\n\n\n\nwhitepaper | Why Today\u2019s Brands Need Fanatics Not Loyalists 4\n\nBut it is important to differentiate between loyalists, advocates, and fanatics as loyalty \nand advocacy are often used interchangeably with fanaticism (and with each other). In \nfact, there are very distinct differences between the actions and mindsets of individuals \nengaging with a brand at each stage of the customer journey.\n\nLoyalist (Customer+)\nLoyalty and advocacy are synergistic, but not interchangeable terms. Once a customer is\nretained and repeat business received, loyalty can be achieved over time\u2014but not every\nloyal customer will become an advocate.\n\nOften companies divert attention, investment, and effort back to new sales generation\nonce a person has been converted to a loyal repeat customer\u2013especially if that customer\nhas liked, followed, and shared.\n\nAdvocate (Loyalist+)\nThe primary difference between an advocate and a loyalist is action on behalf of a brand. \nWhile loyalty is demonstrated by reoccurring transactions, advocacy is equivocal to word-\nof-mouth recommendations, sharing, and even casual defense of a brand if necessary.\n\nFanatic (Advocate+)\nWhatever is true of an advocate is amplified with a fanatic.\n\nA fanatic\u2019s recommendation goes beyond a casual, \u201cYou should try,\u201d to enthusiastic\ninsistence that friends and family take action. Sharing becomes an interpersonal\nexchange whenever the opportunity presents itself. And advocac is no longer limited to\nposting good reviews, but also adamant defense against any disparaging words or actions\n\u2014all while continuing to purchase, like, follow, and share.\n\nRealistically, companies should expect customers to oscillate between loyalty and advocacy,\nbut once fanaticism is achieved these individuals become virtually lifelong ambassadors\nunless poor experiences or treatment change the customers paradigm. And that represents \nthe crux of achieving Fanaticism 2.0\u2014moving customers beyond a transactional and \ntemporary mindset to one that is emotional and driven by a sense of belonging.\n\nLOYALTY + ADVOCACY X PASSION = FANATICISM \n\n\n\nwhitepaper | Why Today\u2019s Brands Need Fanatics Not Loyalists 5\n\nUpgrade your customer funnel seamlessly with the latest technology \n\nThe traditional customer funnel was created to help ensure that companies acquired,\nretained, and grew customers as efficiently and profitably as possible. But today, a\nconsumer expects the brands she loves to not only make recommendations based on\nretrospective insights, but to proactively anticipate her wants and needs. Ad blocking and\nblindness are the ramifications of impersonal (and therefore irrelevant) advertising in a\nmarketplace where consumers are no longer forced to endure it.\n\nIt makes no fiscal sense to increase spending volume to \u201crise above\u201d the noise. A better \ninvestment is in optimized data management, cloud migration, and AI-driven technologies \nwhich are the keys to personalization\u2014the prerequisite for Fanaticism 2.0. Google, \nAmazon, and Netflix are great examples of brands that do just this. At SoftServe we advise \nour clients and provide solutions including, but not limited to:\n\nData optimization\nData is the lifeblood of genuine personalization. It must be consolidated, quality assured, \nand managed properly to ensure optimal results with artificial intelligence, machine \nlearning, natural language processing and more. \n\n\u2022 You don\u2019t become the number one search engine and advertising platform like Google \nwithout perpetually optimized data that drives relevant results for the individual.\n\nCloud migration\nMigration delivers agility for real time data processing and communications and is a\nmust for futureproof preparedness with technological advancements, as well as\nevolving consumer demands.\n\n\u2022 Netflix uses more than 37% of the Internet during peak hours. Let that sink in a \nmoment while you consider if that much personalized content streaming would be \npossible without the agility of the cloud.\n\nArtificial intelligence\nThere are too many touchpoints and data sources to ensure a genuinely personalized \nexperience with every engagement. Artificial intelligence drives machine learning that \nallows for automation, natural language technologies for voice, and smart environments \nthat allow for real time monitoring and response. \n\n\u2022 It wouldn\u2019t be possible to deliver personalized service as the largest store in the world \nwithout artificial intelligence. Just ask Amazon.\n\nThese are the same innovations required for both new business and fan building. With the\nproper foundations and strategies, futureproof technology will upgrade funnels and evolve\nin step with the marketplace\u2014and the individual consumers driving it.\n\n\n\nwhitepaper | Why Today\u2019s Brands Need Fanatics Not Loyalists 6\n\nConclusion\n\nEarning brand champions in today\u2019s marketplace essentially comes down to active listening,\nattentive response, and sustained relationship building.

The enterprise routinely collects \nand acquires necessary data sets, and the analytics team is providing well-crafted \nsummaries companywide.\n\nSo far, so good. But now what?\n\nMany enterprises conceptually understand the value of data, yet most lack formal \ndata valuation policies. Less than half of structured data is actively used in decision-\nmaking. Meanwhile, discovery and preparation consume the majority of the typical data \nanalyst\u2019s time.\n\nThe value of data rests upon its uniqueness, how it is being used, and by whom. There are \nmany opportunities for value extraction from the time the raw data is collected to when \ndata-driven insights are applied\u2014and beyond. \n\nAs a result, any company seeking to improve value must define a clear data value strategy \ndriven by the following questions:\n\n\u2022 How can we leverage our data for maximum business advantage? \n\u2022 Should we use data to raise internal efficiencies, to build competitive advantage, or \n\nboth?\n\nWhile \u201cboth\u201d may seem like the obvious answer, accelerating the journey from status \nquo to new value capture demands vision, discipline, and experience. Without an explicit \ndata value strategy, the latent value buried within the troves of data upon which most \ncompanies now run may remain just that\u2014latent, and ultimately wasted.\n\nGo big with data value (or go home)\n\nMcKinsey reports companies that leverage customer behavior insights outperform peers \nby 85 percent in sales growth. There are two common ways that brands can improve \nbottom-line results by accelerating data value creation:\n\n\u2022 Companies should initiate a discovery and evaluation process to determine what, if any \ndata is already being leveraged properly. Disparate silos and failure to collaborate with \ncommon data will leech productivity, efficiency, and profitability.\n\n\u2022 Investing in the capabilities of internal teams and tools to leverage data assets is also \nkey. No matter how well-tuned data may be, without the proper AI-driven tools (backed \nby a team of data management and analyst experts), top speed potential will never be \nrealized.\n\nAdvanced insights into transactional data can improve consumer identification and deepen \nunderstanding of the underlying behavioral patterns driving purchase decisions. Data \nanalysis will optimize products, services, and processes by enhancing managerial decision-\nmaking. Cloud-driven agility enables companies to do more with the data already gathered \nmuch more quickly and efficiently.\n\nhttps://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/whats-your-data-worth/\nhttps://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/whats-your-data-worth/\nhttps://hbr.org/2017/05/whats-your-data-strategy\nhttps://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/mckinsey-analytics/our-insights/capturing-value-from-your-customer-data\n\n\nwhitepaper | Why You Need a Data Value Strategy 3\n\nNew technological tools signal the next frontier of data value creation. Applications that \nprovide data insights (delivered in intelligible formats) make it easier for less technically \ninclined leadership to make intuitive choices and derive more business benefits. \nPerformance management software enables managers to routinely make data-based \ndecisions. Embedded data visualization software can add value through pattern recognition, \nwhile artificial intelligence (AI) drives machine learning, language, and AR/VR innovation.\n\nBut the benefits of a data value strategy extend beyond current corporate operations. \nThere is often untapped revenue to be captured by applying the analytics that generate \nquality internal insights in ways that external users will find valuable. (For some \ncompanies, it may make sense to focus on complementary data chains so that those may \nlikewise be monetized.)\n\nNavigating new revenue streams\n\nA study of organizations and companies found that while the volume of their stored \ndata was growing on average by 40 percent annually, few had policies in place to \ndetermine the value of this stored data for other potential users. The monetization of \ndata through its sale for use by third parties is a potentially lucrative revenue source.\n\nThe data value chain has multiple points at which value can be extracted, but in order to \nfurther tap this potential resource, an enterprise needs an external value strategy, that is, a \nfull understanding of how to commercialize data (by the regulatory book), including: which \ndata has the greatest value and which formats will prove most useful for external users. \n\nWith that in mind, one of the first steps a company must take is to assess the market \nand determine whether greater benefits will be derived from pursuing enterprise or \nsmaller opportunities. \n\nSetting a strategy must also account for data sets at different stages (raw, processed, or \nin the analysis-and-insights phase), and strategic planners will have to assess how this \nmay impact other stages of data collection and/or analysis. \n\nWith data monetization being a largely unexplored territory for many companies, in-\nhouse valuation expertise may be lacking. Brands need to either create or bolster \ninternal teams and processes that are agile enough to undertake the assessments \nand tasks associated with data value creation. With sufficient internal capabilities, \ncompanies may also consider the benefits of cross-industry alliances\u2014particularly in an \nage where consumers value seamless transactions and integrations.\n\nDISCOVER INGEST PROCESS PERSIST INTEGRATE ANALYZE EXPOSE\n\nhttps://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/whats-your-data-worth/\n\n\nwhitepaper | Why You Need a Data Value Strategy 4\n\nA word of caution\n\nOne cannot seriously consider data monetization without also recognizing the potential \nrisks related to all handling of data. As security concerns continue to increase, companies \nformulating their strategy must make data security integral or face the possibility that \nany value created may be undermined. Concerns may range from an actual breach to a \ncareless employee\u2019s loss of data, along with the almost certain negative publicity.\n\nRegulatory frameworks governing transparency, purpose, consent, and data minimization \nare still evolving across the world. Yet there is general awareness that any data \nmonetization business involves customer privacy issues. Adhering to and demonstrating \nrigorous compliance with security and data protection standards has advanced from being \na nice benefit to becoming prerequisite. However, fear of consumer concerns need not \ninhibit evaluation of the overall market opportunity. \n\nWhat companies need to provide is assurance that consumers are respected; that \nconsumer data is protected, and that consumer data has value. One excellent technique \nis to ensure a valid exchange of value to the end consumer for the usage of their data\u2014a \ncompetitive differentiator from the basic service. Companies may offer a range of insights-\ndriven incentives that customers will gladly exchange personal data for, but this fair \nexchange of value requires testing and creativity. \n\nWhile more could be written on strategy, theory, and best practices\u2014the most effective way to \ndemonstrate the benefits of data value strategy is to share SoftServe\u2019s experience with our clients.\n\nA TALE OF TWO CLIENTS \n\nA company may recognize the value of data and understand that there are insights to be \ngained. Less clear may be which insights are needed, where they can be derived from, and \nwhere learnings can be applied.\n\nClient 1: digital differentiation\n\nDespite vast expertise within its field, one SoftServe client needed assistance in building a \ndifferentiating advantage against competitors with greater digital resources. Focusing on both \ninternal and external strategies, SoftServe helped to digitally transform its global consulting \noperations end-to-end. \n\nThe challenge was two-fold: build digital transformation services for the client\u2019s clients and \ncreate an innovative and transformative internal data value strategy. To help accelerate and \noptimize a truly integrated global platform, SoftServe created several solutions to augment the \nproprietary product, including: \n\n\n\nwhitepaper | Why You Need a Data Value Strategy 5\n\n\u2022 Delivery of an assortment advisor to define optimal price and supply for products \nbased on collected performance data\n\n\u2022 Design and development of an advisor to evaluate the effectiveness of promotional \ncampaigns and marketing budgets\n\n\u2022 Development of a solution to produce predictive and prescriptive analytics using a data \nscience platform \n\n\u2022 Development of a dynamic pricing solution that provides yet another source of data \nanalysis in our client\u2019s portfolio.\n\nClient 2: better sales\n\nA leader in price optimization and pricing management applications, this client sought to \nenhance insights for sales initiatives with the hopes of transforming the rate of contract \nrenewal and prospect retention. To better support these objectives, the company sought \nto provide optimized sales and price recommendations without risking its bottom line. \n\nBuilding upon the client\u2019s existing product while developing a new version, SoftServe \ndeveloped a set of pre-packaged analytic user components:\n\n\u2022 Master data format\n\u2022 Data profiling tool\n\u2022 Automated SSIS packaging\n\u2022 Data quality validation\n\nThese components, combined with several key technologies\u2014predictive analytics, \nsoftware integration, and custom predictive engines\u2014resulted in on-demand, high-\nvalue analytic capabilities. SoftServe\u2019s work enabled prices getting to market significantly \nfaster, cross-browser compatibility of the redesigned interface, improved visual analytics \nwith greater analytical depth, and generally better pricing due to improved precision, \nmarket alignment, and greater transparency. With a clear value strategy in mind, \nSoftServe delivered insights that enabled our client to not only gain value through internal \nperformance optimization but enhanced their positioning with their own clients.\n\nIn closing\n\nAt Softserve, we understand that the value of data depends on both the current and \ndesired (future) state of affairs, and no data value journey will ever be precisely the same. \n\nFrom data pipeline automation to SaaS/RaaS solutions, creating enhanced visualization \ntools, or building a platform to accelerate user insights\u2014our team understands the full \npotential of data.

The \ndemand for cybersecurity professionals is at an all-time high\u2014the profession has an \nunemployment rate of zero. And it\u2019s predicted that by 2020, 100% of large enterprises will \nrequire annual cybersecurity and technology risk reporting to a board of directors.\n\nIt\u2019s safe to say that security is a big deal\u2014and growing more important every day.\n\nIf optimizing your business is about refinement and futureproofing, then doing the \nsame for your security means taking ownership of software, presently and proactively. \nThis pertains to legacy apps and systems requiring modernization, as well as ongoing \ndevelopment that ensures security management while delivering optimal experiences and \nactionable insights.\n\nAs a start, enterprise security fundamentals should be in place. These include: firewalls, \nIDS/IPS appliances, wireless security, and web/email application filtering. If these (and \nother fundamental security measures) are not already in place, it is premature to focus on \noptimization. \n\nHowever, speaking with our clients, there are three areas of security that are consistently \nmost pressing for those with even the most sophisticated security posture:\n\n1. Cloud security\n\n2. Application security assessments\n\n3. Compliance integrity preparation\n\nIn this white paper, we\u2019ll focus on these three areas while sharing insights on event \ndetection and vulnerability management. Most pressing for those with even the most\n\nVULNERABILIT\nY\n\nTH\nRE\n\nAT\nASSET\n\nRISK\n\n\n\nwhitepaper | Fortified Software Security 3\n\nThe security status quo isn't enough\n\nCause and effect: 99% of all cyber exploitation traffic is comprised of known vulnerabilities \n(preventable), which opens the door to 90% of all cyberattack claims stemming from \nhuman error or behavior (inevitable), as evidenced by 91% of all successful attacks \nbeginning with a phishing email (typical).\n\nRegular scans\u2014focused only on critical systems\u2014and reactive patch application is no \nlonger a viable, standalone, vulnerability management strategy.\n\nSecurity management is a layered challenge that requires a multifaceted approach, but the \njourney towards maturity and preparedness begins in part with:\n\n\u2022 Acknowledging current conditions\n\n\u2022 Resolving known issues\n\n\u2022 Paying attention to people and processes (as well as technology)\n\nAcknowledging current conditions\nThis is simply investing the time and resources in discovery to determine the \u201cgood, bad, \nand ugly\u201d of current strategy and readiness\u2014and then taking ownership of whatever is \nneeded to formulate and act on a security strategy that\u2019s right for you. There is no room \nfor excuses, procrastination, or de-prioritization. Breaches tend to cost far more (financially, \nsocially, and to your brand overall) than a systematic vulnerability management plan.\n\nResolving known issues\nIf the majority of cyberattacks occur with known issues, then logic dictates that a company \nendeavors to resolve these issues as quickly as possible. Why knowingly remain at risk if \nresolution is an option? As long as there are predatory cyber criminals, there will always be \nnew and improved issues\u2014but for the sake of your company, remove the threat(s) before \nthere are casualties.\n\nPeople and processes\nTechnology has come a long way, and will go a long way towards defending against \nattack, but human error will continue to be a \u201chole\u201d in the armor as long as people remain \nimperfect. You wouldn\u2019t hand the keys of an exotic sports car to an adolescent with no \nlicense, would you? Why would you make a significant investment in security and not \nensure that everyone within the company is properly trained, prepared, and on guard in \nsupport of your technological counter measures?\n\nIBM (one of our clients) provides a valuable reminder that resolving vulnerability also \ndepends on the IT asset and its role. There is no secret formula or checklist for everyone. \nPatching, disabling, uninstalling, changing configuration, and upgrading are each effective \n\nhttps://chiefexecutive.net/almost-90-cyber-attacks-caused-human-error-behavior/\nhttps://securityintelligence.com/assessing-risks-and-remediating-threats-with-a-layered-approach-to-vulnerability-management/\n\n\nwhitepaper | Fortified Software Security 4\n\nremediation options within a management program. However, the effectiveness of each of \nthese approaches depends entirely on context.\n\nNow let\u2019s dive into some of the biggest, current security concerns on the market.\n\nCloud security is no fluff\n\nMuch has been written on cloud security, and for good reason: it\u2019s the most pressing \ntopic in security today. This is largely due to a misconception that migration to the cloud \nwill render companies more vulnerable than staying put with onsite data storage. This \nerroneous paradigm is changing quickly, however\u2014spurred by the costs of inaction when \nbreaches occur, and bolstered by the realities that many companies face as they move to \nthe cloud.\n\nWith nearly 90% of security leaders making the move to the cloud, questions on cloud \nsecurity should dissipate rapidly\u2013with ample profit and loss incentives to do so.\n\nMigrating to the cloud is simply moving from an existing datacenter to a more secure \nexternal one. AWS, Google, and Microsoft offer platforms much more powerful and secure \nthan most legacy options, but it is important to recognize that these platforms will allow \nalmost \u201canything\u201d installed in the virtual machine. The security model for cloud providers \nisn\u2019t a one-size-fits-all, but rather a shared responsibility model, in which both the business \nand the cloud provider share security.\n\nIn short, the greatest vehicle is ultimately only as good as the driver, tuning, and \nmaintenance schedule. To get the most from a cloud migration, the inherent platform \nsecurity requires a team of specialists capable of not only maintenance, but also \ncustomization and fine tuning (optimization). For example, SoftServe specializes in areas \nlike egress/ingress point security, allowing our clients to have a better analysis of what \ndata is actually moving in and out of their cloud infrastructure. This allows them to dive \ndeeper into their cloud capabilities in a highly customized and optimized fashion.\n\nof business leaders are employing \na multi-cloud strategy \n(Forrester)\n\n\n\nwhitepaper | Fortified Software Security 5\n\nCloud security is no fluff\n\nThe battle against cyberattacks is real and ongoing\u2014but far better to assess and ensure \nsecurity prior to release than discover vulnerabilities after the fact. And for legacy \nsoftware, there\u2019s no better time than the present.\n\nDevelopers generally don\u2019t like to work with legacy software for numerous reasons\u2014\nassumed vulnerability, likelihood of vulnerability, and someone else\u2019s work\u2014but net new \ndevelopment is not always an option, or what\u2019s necessarily best for the company.\n\nAn assessment is key because it\u2019s impossible to know where to go or how best to get there \nwithout knowing the current state of your software.\n\nThere are two prefaces to assessing (and ensuring) inherent security in DevOps:\n\n1. Stop viewing security as a non-functional requirement\n\n2. Insist on agile security practices and tools\n\nAt SoftServe, we pride ourselves on being agile and fluid. We recommend the same when \nbuilding a security culture. Net new development should be inherently secure throughout \nthe process. There are a number of ways to ensure this including: putting developers in \ncharge of secure development, continuous integration security practices in the SDLC, and \nbuilding user stories.\n\nIn addition to the full-time effort teams should dedicate to vulnerability management, \nsecurity should be inherently built into every project from inception to PoC to launch. For \nlegacy systems, a software security assessment is vital to know the best course of action, \nand outside expertise should be leveraged if necessary to make it so.\n\n\u201cOnly one third of organizations believe they have adequate resources to \nmanage security effectively.\u201d \n\n(Ponemon Institute)\n\n\n\nwhitepaper | Fortified Software Security 6\n\nResistance is futile\u2014compliance is mandatory\n\nSecurity and compliance are often grouped together, but distinguishing them from one \nanother is important. Being compliant, for example, does not necessarily ensure security. \nBut establishing security within compliance is imperative, especially in the wake of new \nregulations such as GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation).\n\nGDPR is the first wave of a sweeping regulation, but more sophisticated, geographic-\nspecific changes are on the way. This trend may be seen with companies affected by GDPR \nas well, considering more than half of GDPR affected companies will likely be noncompliant \nby end of year. In the US, this trend is called a \u201ccompliance salad\u201d where different versions \nof websites are produced based on variable compliance standards from state to state.\n\nThose without adequate resources to manage both security and compliance effectively \nshould seek outside expertise sooner than later. Once a company can check all regulatory \nboxes, optimizing applicable security is the next step.\n\nAt SoftServe, for example, we guide our clients to improve digital maturity and security \nposture so that when it\u2019s time to be certified, the process is streamlined and simple\u2014test \npreparation if you will. And where multiple contractors are employed, our experts provide \nredundant verification to ensure the work of others is properly driving certification as well.\n\nSecurity is in our DNA \n\nCloud security, risk assessment, and compliance readiness are only a few of the security \nchallenges facing most businesses today. Identifying where your security stands, where it \nneeds to go, and how to get there can literally be a million-dollar question.\n\nDifferent industries have different regulations that require different preparedness \nstrategies. Sometimes modernizing legacy software is enough, but oftentimes it is not. \nThere is no one-size-fits-all solution in a world where cyber criminals are in a perpetual \nchess match with developers, ethical hackers, and other security professionals.\n\nSoftServe\u2019s methodology for each client and project is secure by design and has been for \nover 25 years.

The system consists of two parts: a TEG module and a \nPCB board with plastic fixture. The TEG module acts as the energy source when there is a \ntemperature difference between the top and the bottom sides. The generated voltage and \ncurrent depend on actual working conditions. (For example: 50mV from the human hand, \nwhen environment temperature is 21\u030a C.) Laird for power harvesting from human skin was \nused. The figure bellow shows the first tests:\n\nFigure 1. First TEG test\n\nFigure 2. Temperature difference\n\nFigure 3. Final prototype\n\nCooled side\n\nDisipated Heat\n\nhttps://eu.mouser.com/ProductDetail/739-430820-501\n\n\nwhitepaper | Tegband: implementing a thermoelectric generator band 3\n\nThe TEG module was placed in a metal cover with a radiator installed on top of the \ncold side. The radiator helps to dissipate heat on the top side to keep the temperature \ndifference over time. The TEG module and overall case tend to have the same temperature \nas the body does, so heat dissipation is important for the further work of the module.\n\nFigure 4. TegBand Top level system diagram\n\nTo use TEG output voltage, a step-up converter (LTC3108) was involved. It can operate from \n20mV input voltage and provide the stabilized 5V output.\n\nThe step-up DC/DC converter work is based on the transformer usage (1:100). By switching \noff the primary coil of the transformer, it generates AC voltage from a low-level TEG signal. \nAn amplified signal of the secondary coil is then rectified and used by charging the circuit \ninside the IC to a charge storage capacitor.\n\nChannel descriptions: \n\u2022 TEG input switched at 50mV\n\n\u2022 Transformer Output\n\n\u2022 Storage Capacitor (VSTORE)\n\nFigure 5. Signals on the human touch to TEG\n\nThe charge level of the storage capacitor is monitored by a low power comparator with \ninternal reference MAX9064. The comparator is set to turn on when the input is above \n3.8V and turn off when it\u2019s below 2.5V. The 1.3V hysteresis allows us to use part of the \nstored energy:\n\nTEG\nElement\n\nLDO\nTPS7A05\n\nStorage\nCapacitor\n\nComparator\n\nVdd = 2.5V\n\nHarvesting\nIC\nLTC3108\n\nMCU\n12CStatus\n\nLED\nSensor\nHTS221\n\nE =      CU  = = 1.27mJ(mWs)(1.5   10    1.3  )\n22 -31\n\n2\n1\n2\n\n\n\nwhitepaper | Tegband: implementing a thermoelectric generator band 4\n\nThe discharge speed of the storage highly depends on the average current consumption.\n\nTo minimize the current leakage, a low quiescent current low-dropout regulator (LDO \u2013 \nTPS7A05) was selected. Typically, it consumes 1uA, and the enabled input of LDO is used to \ndisable the power supply of the load when the storage capacitor discharges, or does not \nreach the maximal charge level.\n\nThe analog comparator is used to control enabled input of LDO. When the comparator \noutput is high, it enables the LDO to provide a stable 2.5V to the MCU and sensor. When \nthe storage capacitor is discharged to 2.5V, the comparator output will drop down and \ndisable the load supply through the LDO. Then the charge-discharge process on the \nstorage capacitor repeats again.\n\nFigure 6. Power Control Subsystem\n\nFigure 7. Charge\\Discharge process on the storage capacitor\n\nThe upper threshold to turn on the load \nwas intentionally selected lower (3.8V) than \nthe maximum (5V). After the TEG band is \nplaced the power output decreases as the \nskin becomes colder, and both the case \nand the radiator temperatures rise. The \npower output of the TEG reaches around \n20mV-40mV, depending on environmental \nconditions. In this case, multiplication with \nthe transformer (1:100) won\u2019t exceed a \nvoltage of 4V.\n\nTo monitor power consumption, an \nX-NUCLEO-LPM01A kit was used. Power \nmonitoring helps to pinpoint a preferable \nmodel for communication and update the \nspeed of the sensor data.\n\nThere are three main elements in the design that consume power: Cortex M-0 MCU with \nBLE(CY8C4248LQI-BL553), a sensor that measures temperature and humidity (HTS221), \nand the LED.\n\n\n\nwhitepaper | Tegband: implementing a thermoelectric generator band 5\n\nTo visually show that the system works and transfers data, the LED turns on once per \nsecond for a short time (1ms).\n\nFigure 8. Overall system power consumption chart\n\nThe monitor allows the identification of the two types of spikes that influence the level of \naverage power consumption. The regular advertise event is configured in BLE module to \nbe sent once a second. These spikes have big amplitude (22mA) and short duration (5us). \nThe smaller advertising interval increases sensors stream data rate but also it makes the \ncurrent consumption grow.\n\nThe current consumption of the temperature and humidity sensors is fixed (~600uA) and \ndepends on the configuration settings being used. It can be configured to measure the \ndata periodically or upon request.\n\nTime (s)\n\nTemperature \nand humidity measure\n\nBLE\nadvertisement\n\n0\n\n2500\n\n5000\n\n7500\n\n10000\n\n12500\n\n15000\n\n17500\n\n20000\n\n25000\n\n00 ,5 11 ,5 22 ,5 33 ,5 44 ,5 5\n\nFULL\n\nCurrent0 ,000 22277,832 93,746 11817,080 0,000 22247,314 95,110 1188,871\nMin.

Source: datasheet\n\nIt was decided not to use a connectable Broadcaster BLE role and, instead, to update the \nadvertising packet for data transfers. This allows for the sending of update information \nevery second, prolonging battery life. A connection mode with long connection intervals \ncan also be used for a similar approach but, in the event of packet loss, the connection \nwill be unstable and cause reconnect events that both disrupt software functionality and \nincrease power consumption.\n\nOptimizing MCU is sufficient. The actual current consumption of the MCU depends on its \nmode (Active, Sleep, Deep Sleep, Hibernate, Stop). Each of these modes has different levels \nof consumption, and uses different resources and wake-up sources to get back into an \nactive state. To minimize the current consumption, most of the time must be spent in one \nof the low-power modes, waking up from one of the sources and doing a useful job for a \nsmall period of time. Check the figure below. In this project, we used the Deep Sleep mode \nfor power saving as it doesn\u2019t require an external hardware wake-up source and simplifies \nfirmware management. In Stop and Hibernate modes, the MCU needs to use a special pin \nor low power comparator as a wake-up source and the wake-up process is equal to reset. \nTo avoid this, Deep Sleep was selected as the main power saving mode.\n\nThe other important parameter is the MCU frequency. The processor datasheet identifies: \n2.1mA @ CPU = 3MHz, and 13.4mA @ CPU = 48 MHz. One of the first steps is to decrease \nCPU speed to minimize power consumption. Two other considerations were critical in this \ndesign:\n\n\u2022 SWD pins for debugging should be put in GPIO mode to minimize power consumption.\n\n\u2022 The 24MHz External Crystal Oscillator (ECO) and 32kHz Watch Crystal Oscillator (WCO) \nstabilization time at power up can be around 500ms, during this time, the device will be \nin active mode and cause high power consumption. This may lead to exhausting of all \nharvested energy even before the initialization ends. The workaround is to boot using \nthe Internal Main Oscillator (IMO) and Internal Low Speed Oscillator (ILO) and switch to \nthe external oscillators\u2019 usage after initialization is finished.\n\nXRES / Brownout /\nPower On Reset\n\nReset\n\nActive\n\nSleep\n\nDeep Sleep\n\nHibernate\n\nInternal Reset Event\n\nExternal Reset Event\n\nFirmware Action\n\nOther External Event\n\nPower Mode Action\n\nStop\n\nInternal\nResets\n\nWakeup\nInterrupt\n\nFirmware\nAction\n\nWakeup\nInterupt\n\nWakeup\nAsserts\n\n\n\nwhitepaper | Tegband: implementing a thermoelectric generator band 7\n\nSOFTWARE\nThe Android application was developed to graphically represent \nthe sensor\u2019s data. \nThe application continuously scans for Bluetooth advertising \npackets and when the packet from TegBand is received, the charts \nget updated with the new values (humidity and temperature). \nThe red background circles blink when new data is acquired, \nhighlighting a new event.\n\nCONCLUSION\nThe development of the ultra-low-power MCUs and low-energy communication has \nbrought the possibility of creating battery-free wireless sensor nodes, which are becoming \nubiquitous. The built prototype uses thermal energy-harvesting for continuous work in \nbeaconing mode (one-way data-sending). Involved techniques allow for building battery-\nfree devices from wearable electronics to industrial systems, with no need to replace, \nrecharge, or maintain battery. Future work should be focusing on much more complicated \ntasks, such as bi-directional communication between the devices to create highly reliable \nunmaintained mesh networks.\n\nFigure 11.

Although the requirements and the implementations for each agency were similar, \nsome requirements were unique. SoftServe\u2019s main task was to provide the state agencies \nwith a number of the application maintenance support services, such as development, \ntesting, deployment, and new functionality support, as well as 24-hour support service \nduring the payroll calculation period.\n\nProject Description\n\nThe requirements manager role was essential in solving the number of maintenance \nsupport tasks, such as:\n\n\u2022 Analyzing problems raised by the client\u2019s support center and identifying the root cause \n\u2022 Providing an explanation of the problem\u2019s root cause\n\u2022 Proposing a workaround using existing functionality\n\u2022 Providing an explanation when the existing system is not able to perform according to \n\nthe customer request\n\u2022 Assisting in bug fixes for the issues related to the custom payroll system\n\nThis process is followed for each issue.

Of course, in the high-paced world \nof technology, 20 years is an admirable \nspan. Yet, despite that, the seemingly \nancient Agile methodology is being applied \non a bigger and bigger scale in digital \nenterprises across industries. In addition, \nthere are multiple historical cases where \ninnovative engineering teams successfully \nused the same management principles. \nThe most vivid example is Skunk Works \nand related 14 principles, dating back to \nthe 1940s, partially overlapping with Agile.\n\nThis paper aims to find a historical \nanalogy to the Scaled Agile Framework \u2013 a \nmethodology based on Agile but applied \non a broader scale. The historical analogy \ncan be found at the beginning of the 19th \ncentury in post-revolutionary France. \n\nThe turmoil and innovations triggered back \nthen shaped Europe for the coming century \n\u2013 similar to how digital is now transforming \nindustries for coming decades. \n\nNAPOLEON \u2013 THE GREAT INNOVATOR \n\nMore than 200 years ago, France was ruled \nby Napoleon Bonaparte, an influential \npolitical and military leader. Napoleonic \nreforms were huge innovations for the \n19th century and laid a foundation for \nour modern world. Napoleon\u2019s military \nreforms were equally influential and \nredefined warfare for the coming century.  \n\nAs with any military conflict, Napoleonic \nwars were mayhem and led to the \nsuffering and death of countless innocent \nindividuals. Without glorifying the \nwars of Napoleon, we aim to get some \npractical wisdom from the Napoleonic \narmy (Grande Arm\u00e9e) and apply it to \nchallenges of Agile product development. \n\n\n\nSolution Brief Napoleon and the Scaled Agile Framework 3\n\nThe post-revolutionary French Grande \nArm\u00e9e was successful in multiple battles. \nPart of the success of the Grande Arm\u00e9e \nwas due to the character of its soldiers \nand officers. The French Revolution broke \nthe longstanding social class system \nand opened military service to all social \nclasses. It was a merit-based organization \nwith great pride in the French Republic \nand its principles. The Grande Arm\u00e9e \ndiffered from other armies, which often \nconsisted of unmotivated individuals, \nlacking shared vision and goals. \n\nJacques Antoine Hippolyte, Comte de \nGuibert, an 18th-century influential \nmilitary thinker, proposed citizen armies \nin 1770. He predicted a national army \nwould easily defeat a mercenary army \nand advocated for permanent divisions \nwith high mobility capabilities. Napol\u00e9on \nstudied Comte de Guibert\u2019s work and \napplied the same principles to the Grande \nArm\u00e9e by paying particular attention to \nthe troop\u2019s morale and welfare. As a result, \narmy regiments were not dismissed after \ncampaigns, and regiment group identity \nwas welcomed (this practice lives in many \nof the world\u2019s armed forces today). \n\nMore than 200 years later, motivated and \nproductive people still are prerequisites for \nsuccess, especially in a highly competitive \ndigital industry. Historically, the software \nindustry had a mixed reputation in regards \nto employee motivation and engagement. \nThis was reflected in popular cultures such \nas the Dilbert comics and the Hollywood \nmovie Office Space. Industry corrected \nitself and came up with the Scrum \nmethodology. There are clear analogies \nbetween principles advocated in Agile \n\nand principles of the Grande Arm\u00e9e. Agile \nmethodology advocates for self-motivated, \ncross-functional, and customer-focused \nteam members. Agile also emphasizes the \nnecessity of having a permanent, long-\nterm team. This collides with the idea of \nemploying specialized professionals and \ntemporary project-based teams, which \nprevailed in the software industry before \n1990. The presence of group bonding, \nmutual trust, unity, and cohesion remains \ncrucial in today\u2019s digital economy.  \n\nLESSON #1:  \nTHE MOTIVATED INDIVIDUAL \n\n\n\nSolution Brief Napoleon and the Scaled Agile Framework 4\n\nThe basis of the Grande Arm\u00e9e organization \nwas the army corps\u2014a combination of \ninfantry, artillery, and a brigade of cavalry, \nplus detachments of engineers. The army \ncorps was an autonomous, independent, \nand self-sufficient fighting detachment \nbecause it could operate at a distance \nfrom other units and with little supervision \nfrom headquarters. On the other hand, \nthe Grande Arm\u00e9e was not a functional \norganization\u2014there was no \u201cChief Artillery \nMarshal\u201d supervising artillery units. \n\nLESSON #2:  \nTHE CROSS-FUNCTIONAL AUTONOMOUS TEAM \n\n\n\nSolution Brief Napoleon and the Scaled Agile Framework 5\n\nThe same principle can be found in Agile Manifesto principles:  \n\u201cThe best architectures, requirements, and designs \nemerge from self-organizing teams.\u201d  \n\nIn software development, cross-functional \nteams were introduced by the Scrum \nmethodology and re-emphasized later by \nthe DevOps movement. Despite industry \nadoption and scientifically recognized \nbenefits, not all enterprises adopted this \napproach\u2014especially product development \nteams. Similar to the Grande Arm\u00e9e\u2019s ideas, \nthe Scaled Agile Framework emphasizes the \navoidance of functional offices. Requiring \nteam members with programming \nskills to report to the development \nmanager and QA-skilled team members \nreporting to a QA manager fails to create \ngreat teams. Conflicting loyalties are \nundesirable both in military organizations \nand in a digital product company. \n\nIT professionals adopt the same approach \nin SAFe teams\u2013largely autonomous, \ndriven by outcomes, not outputs. Overall \ndirection for product development effort \nis derived from a business\u2019 mission and \nvision. Priorities for the development of \nnew features are customer-driven. Daily \ndecision-making is pushed down from \nhigher levels of the business down to team \nlevel, alongside responsibility for outcomes. \n\nThe idea behind the corps system was to \ncreate an organization that could function \nautonomously. Every individual corps was \na self-contained army, led by a marshal and \nstaff corps, including military elements, \ninternal command, and control networks. \nWhile independent, each army corps \ncommander knew the overall strategic \nplan and current commander\u2019s intent and \nacted aligned with those plans. Marshal \nwas required to operate following the \nstrategic plan, but at the same time, this \nperson was free to decide how to best \nprepare for an upcoming engagement. \n\n\n\nSolution Brief Napoleon and the Scaled Agile Framework 6\n\nThe next innovation of the Grande Arm\u00e9e \nwas the ability to coordinate movements \nand concentrate forces in decisive \nmoments of the battle. Despite having \ncapabilities to act autonomously, all army \ncorps were in constant communication \nwith headquarters. Every army corp staff in \nthe days of active troop movements would \nproduce a daily report and deliver it back \nto the general staff. After disseminating \nand analyzing incoming messages, \nheadquarters would issue marching orders \nto individual corps for the upcoming day. \nThe unique capability of the Grande Arm\u00e9e \nwas to \u201cmarch divided, fight united.\u201d Thus, \nthe French coordinated movements of army \ncorps across vast distances and were able \nto confuse and out-maneuver other armies.  \n\nLESSON #3:  \nTEAM COORDINATION AND CADENCE \n\n\n\nSolution Brief Napoleon and the Scaled Agile Framework 7\n\nA team of teams is a widely used \nterm to describe the collaboration \nbetween independent and autonomous \ngroups working towards a common \ngoal. So naturally, there is a need to \ncoordinate the efforts of multiple \nteams regularly (cadence). \n\nAgile Release Trains and cadence \nsynchronization is a direct analogy of the \nsame principle. Teams are challenged by \ntechnical uncertainties independently \n(\u201cmarch divided\u201d), yet the continuous \nintegration principle ensures the system \nis iterating as a whole (\u201cfight united\u201d). \n\nSys 1\n\nIterate Iterate Iterate Iterate Iterate Iterate Iterate Iterate\n\nIterate Iterate Iterate Iterate Iterate Iterate Iterate Iterate\n\nIterate Iterate Iterate Iterate Iterate Iterate Iterate Iterate\n\nSys 2\n\nSytem Demos\nProbably need help\nfrom a system team Sytem Demos\n\nPIPI\n\nSys 3 Sys 4 Sys 5 Sys 6 Sys 7 Sys 8\n\nContinuous Integration\n\nContinuous Integration\n\nIronically, failure to coordinate the efforts of multiple teams (army corps) was \none of the reasons for the defeat at Waterloo\u2014while the French had troubles \nwith directing movements, adversaries beat them at their own game.  \n\nImage source \n\n\n\nSolution Brief Napoleon and the Scaled Agile Framework 8\n\nStakes were high for Napol\u00e9on\u2014the fate \nof the French Republic depended on the \nmilitary successes of the Grande Arm\u00e9e. \nNapol\u00e9on carried a packet of poison \nwith him and was willing to commit \nsuicide to avoid being captured. From a \nmilitary standpoint, Napol\u00e9on acted as \nhis own operations officer. He required \nno advice from his generals and carried \nultimate responsibility for his decisions.  \n\nIf we look at software development, the \nSAFe methodology embraces a product \nowner role. Emphasis is put on the fact \nthat this is a single person, with the \nprimary function of managing the product \nbacklog and ensuring the value of work \nthat the Agile team performs. A good \nproduct owner combines contradictory \ntraits of a doer, a visionary leader, and \na team player at the same time.  \n\nOrganizations have difficulty finding \npeople with sufficient breadth and \ndepth of experience and skills to fill \na product owner\u2019s role. A common \nmistake is to substitute a single product \nowner with a committee of multiple \npeople without anyone in charge. As \na result, the committee is often lost \nin long meetings, usually consisting \nof company politics and conflicts.  \n\nNapol\u00e9on was an eminently qualified \ncompany-wide business owner because \nhe transformed post-revolutionary \nFrance into a unified country with a \nstable economy and a world-class army. \nWhile commanding his troops, he acted \nas the product manager of a military \ncampaign. During the Napol\u00e9onic wars, his \nadversaries were coalitions of monarchies \nthat often lacked unity of command. \nAs a supreme commander (a product \nmanager), Napol\u00e9on was able to react \nquickly to tactical situations. At the same \ntime, his enemies were busy negotiating \namongst themselves in the same \nmanner as product owners committees \n\nLESSON #4:  \nTHE IMPORTANCE OF A PRODUCT OWNER \n\nNapoleon and the Scaled Agile Framework 8Solution Brief\n\n\n\nSolution Brief Napoleon and the Scaled Agile Framework 9\n\nAnother critical element of the Grande \nArm\u00e9e organization was the general staff. It \nwould serve as the backbone of a command \nand control network. It was led by Marshal \nBerthier and included many knowledgeable \nofficers who provided all types of \ninformation necessary for military planning. \nFor example, Berthier\u2019s aides provided \ninformation on types of roads, layouts \nof towns, and the quality of equipment \ncarried by enemy units. The chief of staff\u2019s \nduties consisted of maintaining situation \nreports, dispatching orders, maintaining \nan army\u2019s war diary and maps, keeping \nregisters, and conducting inspections. \n\nIn the day, the general staff was to \nacquire, analyze, de-conflict, and internally \ndisseminate incoming information before \nconducting actions. In the SAFe framework, \nthe functions of available staff do not have \na direct equivalent. Some of the functions \nare in System Architect/Engineering, \nRelease Train Engineer roles, and the \nSystem Team. Other functions are replaced \nby the practice of Scrum of Scrums or \nProduct Owner Sync.  The function of \ndisseminating and analyzing information \nis scattered around all SAFe practices. \n\nContrary to Napoleonic times, the \ncontinuous learning principle encourages \nlearning at all levels, not only at the \nhigher level of the general staff. \n\nLESSON #5:  \nTHE RELEASE TRAIN ENGINEER  \nAND THE GENERAL STAFF \n\n\n\nSolution Brief Napoleon and the Scaled Agile Framework 10\n\nDigital enterprise requires new \norganizational design, and companies \nface challenges to embrace new ways \nof working. Digital value delivery \ndemands a paradigm shift, from project-\nbased, top-to-bottom designed, batch-\nbased value delivery to continuous, \nbottom-up, emergent products.  \n\nA subtle balance should be maintained \nbetween agile development methods, \ntraditional activities from enterprise \narchitecture domains, and software \narchitecture. There is no single recipe \nor practice universally applicable to all \nbusinesses, as every business context is \ndifferent. At SoftServe, we are running \nmultiple successful product development \ninitiatives using the SAFe methodology.  \nStill, any methodology will fail if a business \nlacks its most valuable capital\u2014human \ncapital. Napol\u00e9on believed the secret \nto success in military campaigns was \n75% \u201cesprit de corps,\u201d and a mere 25%  \nwas devoted to the number of troops \nand equipment quality. 200 years after \nthe Grande Arm\u00e9e, the Agile Manifesto \nstated the following principle:  \n\nRegardless of what your business is \ndoing, motivated individuals are a \nprerequisite to succeed in the neverending \ncampaign of a modern economy. \n\nBuild projects around motivated individuals. Give them the environment \nand support they need, and trust them to get the job done. \n\nCONCLUSION \n\n\n\nSolution Brief Napoleon and the Scaled Agile Framework 11\n\nSoftServe has longstanding experience \nbuilding cross-functional agile teams. \nWe co-create innovation via the services \nof product management, product \ndevelopment, and multiple Scrum \nteam coordination.

One of \nthe use cases is preventing the failure of \nvalves which are involved in the process of \nbuilding chemical based products. \n\nTypically, companies experience issues \nduring pressurization, and when a poppet \nvalve fails, the factory has to be stopped \nor production paused for maintenance\u2013\nresulting in lost time and revenue.

Some key challenges included \nnoisy real-world sensor data, too few fails \nof individual components to easily extract \npatterns, and no clear difference in data \nbetween fail and maintenance periods. \nThese chalenges produced several errors \nin labeled data.\n\nTraining data included: \n\n\u2022 Cooler, plunger, hyper section \ntemperatures\n\n\u2022 Plunger positions, discharger pressures, \ngas flow rates\n\n\u2022 Statistics on ~100 historical failures  \nfor eight different components\n\nTechnologies used:\n\n\u2022 XGBoost, group-based cross-validation\n\u2022 Python for data processing  \n\nand modeling\n\u2022 GCP for data storage\n\nValue Delivered\nDuring the PoC phase, delivered in \nfour weeks, almost 5000 time series \ncharacteristics were generated each day \nto build an accurate prediction model.

While there \n\nare several options for creating or buying \nrole-based competency models, the current \nprocess to create competency-based learning \nis human labor-intensive.\n\nCustomers and prospects perceived the \nmanual effort of mapping tasks to learning \nactivities (in order to create competen-\ncy-based learning) as too difficult and too \ntime consuming. This began impacting new \nbusiness opportunities.\n\nCurrent customer alternatives include engaging \nSkillDirector to perform this service for them, \nor using the step-by-step instruction and \nmaterials provided by SkillDirector to do it \nthemselves. Regardless of who does the \nmapping, it relies on a list of applicable activ-\nities for a role. When performed with a filtered \nlist of activities, this process takes 1-2 weeks \nper role.\n\nHowever, due to the often poor metadata \nassociated with current learning activities \nin their Learning Management Systems, \ncustomers find it difficult to create a filtered \nlist of activities, leaving them with poten-\ntially thousands to consider, which increases \nthe duration, complexity, and tedium. \n\nSkillDirector needed to scale the process of \nmapping learning opportunities to tasks by \nperforming fast AI-enabled mapping, lever-\naging natural language processing.\n\nThis would enable them to more quickly \nonboard new clients by decreasing the compe-\ntency-based learning development time \nfrom days to hours. And it alleviated the \nmental hurdle and frustration by providing \ncustomers with a way to eliminate most of \nthe manual process. This could also be used \ninternally to support more services work \nwith the same resources, as well as serve as \na marketing tool for differentiation.\n\nEssentially, an AI-powered platform would \ngive SkillDirector the ability to win more \nbusiness, perform services more efficiently \nand profitably, and drive lead generation.\n\n\n\ncase study |    Ai-Enabled Mapping Leveraging Natural Language Processing \n      Decreases Onboarding Time Of New Customers For Skilldirector\n\n4\n\nProject Description\n\noftServe developed an AI-enabled solution \nfor automatic mapping of top learning \nactivities per each task.

It brings \ntogether a team of exceptional realtors, \nan online Austin home search tool, and a \nhighly efficient home marketing strategy. \nA 35-member support staff helps its 500+ \nagents increase their sales an average of \n27% per year.\n\nBusiness Challenge\n\nur client had an old website that \nwas created ages ago. This meant \nthat their competitors\u2019 websites had \n\nbetter design, user experience, and overall \nfunctionality. The company also used a lot of \ndifferent programs to manage the business \n- SEO was severely lacking, the admin panel \nwas not user friendly, and managing pages \nvia their old CMS was a massive headache. \n\nThe company\u2019s goal was to become the #1 \nrealty company in Texas and eventually the \nUS market. To be competitive in the Texas \nreal estate business it had to be more \nattractive to new agents. This required  \nbetter UX and SEO than the competition, \nand more user friendly functionality for \nagents. As our client was rapidly expanding, \nthey needed technology that could scale \nand manage many agents, properties, and \nbuyers/sellers.\n\nFaster website management would result in \nlower admin expenses. Instead of creating \neach page via CMS, listings pages could be \ncreated automatically. The admin panel \nwould be based on one platform, rather \nthan having admin/CMS programs managed \nby other companies, such as Salesforce.\n\n\n\ncase study |    Leading Realty Company Builds UX Friendly \n      Website To Realize Competitive Differentiation\n\n3\n\nProject Description\n\noftServe guided the client in creating a \nnew website with high quality UX/UI for \nbuyers, easy to use agent dashboards, \n\nand agent-client/client-client communication \nand notification tools. Our work with our \nclient is ongoing with the following planned \nadditions: SEO, recommendation engine, \nreactive app, and seller functionality.\n\nAfter an initial design thinking workshop, \nSoftServe conducted a nine-month MVP \nprocess that brought in top producing agents to \nbetter understand where the current solutions \nwere failing to deliver the experience that our \nclient needed to provide its agents. This included \nbuilding agent personas and competitive \nanalysis (Keller Williams, Compass, Zillow) to \noutline and deliver the scope of the initial IP.\n\nValue Delivered\n\nhe new website is much faster and \nwill bring more leads through the \nimplementation of user friendly ways \n\nto search for properties and prompts for \nusers to sign up. SEO was also optimized \nwhich should increase website traffic.\n\nNow, instead of using an admin panel, \nCMS, and Salesforce separately to manage \nthe website, agents/admins only need to \nmanage two website dashboards for agents \nand Salesforce.\n\nThis saves considerable time with website \nmanagement. The old website had \nthousands of pages that an army of admin \npersonnel had to curate. Now, instead of  \nneighborhood pages managed via CMS, \nthose are automatically generated from \nMLS data. Instead of having to create listings \npages and info via admin panel + CMS tool + \nSalesforce, data is now managed directly in \nSalesforce only and synced with the website.\n\n\n\nABOUT US\nSoftServe is a digital authority that advises and provides at the \ncutting-edge of technology.

The concept of a traditional \nadvertising agency planning large multichannel media campaigns, charging \nlarge fees for creative concepts, and reaping the benefits of commissions \nfrom large media buys, is a distant memory. \n\nAgency Challenges\n\nToday\u2019s agency landscape is made up of niche players that define \nthemselves in unique ways, specializing in creative, digital, design, social, \nSEO, multi-cultural, etc. \n\nThe consolidation of agencies under large global holding companies has \nalso created fragmentation in the marketplace. The vision being to create a \nportfolio ecosystem of \u201csister\u201d or \u201cpartner\u201d agencies that could collaborate \ntogether, each would provide their own unique focus and deliver a \ncohesive multi-disciplinary, end-to-end on experience for the client. In \nreality, these large holding companies have created a complex series of \nloosely affiliated agencies that do not communicate, and sometimes even \ncompete for the same client business. \n\nAnother issue plaguing the industry is large global consulting firms, \nincluding the big four. These firms have been on a buying spree of digital \nagencies and design firms in an effort to own more of their strategy\u2019s \ntactical implementation, not to mention the often lucrative design and \ndevelopment work. But this trend has caused the lines between large \nconsulting firms and small agencies to blur. Subsequently, a new trend has \nemerged with the likes of digital agencies, such as R/GA, providing more of \nthe upfront consulting work. This allows them to provide business strategy \nservices required to help enable their clients transform their business \nmodels and revenue streams to be more digitally focused. \n\n\n\nwhitepaper\n\nA CASE FOR DIGITAL ASSET MANAGEMENT IN AGENCIES 3\n\nEven traditional client companies who previously relied on an army of \nagencies are moving their efforts to be more focused in-house. Capital \nOne, for example, stepped away from relying solely on agencies and \nrecently purchased Adaptive Path, a design agency, to bring design \nthinking and innovation in-house. Companies like IBM and Facebook have \nmade similar acquisitions.\n\nAll of these factors have created a scenario where long-term incumbent \nagency and retainer-based business models have morphed into more \nproject-based, transactional, and highly commoditized scenarios. How can \nagencies stay competitive in this environment? \n\nAgencies can take a cue from all of the other industries that have had \ntheir legacy business models disrupted by more agile, customer-focused \nplayers. There is a lot to be learned from the Amazons, Ubers, and Airbnbs \nof digital disruption fame. All of these new players, in their respective \nverticals, have redefined and dominated their industries and set a higher \nbar for customer expectation. They have achieved this largely by taking \nthe time to understand their customers, designing experiences that solve \ncommon problems, and harnessing technology to facilitate complicated \ntransactions that previously were not considered possible. Why should \nclients have expectations of their agencies that differ from what they, as \nindividuals, have from their banks, airlines, car services, and retailers? \n\n\n\nwhitepaper\n\nA CASE FOR DIGITAL ASSET MANAGEMENT IN AGENCIES 4\n\nTransforming the Relationship \n\nEven savvy digital agencies that specialize in highly personalized \ncustomer experiences tend to fall back on old analog habits when it \ncomes communicating with their clients. Agencies that design and build \nincredible digital solutions for their clients have failed to invest in their \nown transformations. This is where the change needs to happen and, like \nthe very clients they serve, this change is about the necessity for survival. \nJust like today\u2019s transformative business models are all about customer-\ncentricity, the client-agency model also needs to be more personal, \ndigitally convenient, contextually aware, real-time, socially connected, and \nvaluable beyond the transaction. The transformation for agencies is about \nbuilding and fostering relationships. \n\nDAM as a Foundation for Collaboration\n\nMost of the collaboration between agencies and clients focuses around \ncreative ideas, design ideation, layouts, artwork\u2014in other words \nmedia and content. It would make sense, therefore, that the platform \nfacilitating the closest agency-client connection would enable quick \nsharing and content collaboration. Digital Asset Management (DAM) is \nthis foundational platform. DAM is the term the technology industry has \nsettled on to describe software platforms that manage unstructured \ncontent such as images and video. It will provide agencies with the ability \nto share, collaborate, and distribute content between agencies, clients, \nand the various media channels. The native qualities of enterprise DAM \nsystems can be harnessed to facilitate a variety of digitally convenient, \nreal-time, tightly coupled processes. These not only provide a wealth of \nefficiencies but, more importantly, create relationships that are seamlessly \nconnected through digital platforms. \n\nThe native qualities of enterprise DAM systems can be \nharnessed to facilitate a variety of digitally convenient, \nreal-time, tightly coupled processes.\n\n\n\nwhitepaper\n\nA CASE FOR DIGITAL ASSET MANAGEMENT IN AGENCIES 5\n\nEnabling Experiences Not Transactions \n\nOne of the things that digital disrupters do really well is improve the \ncustomer experience. They focus on the journey and then present the \nbest contextually-based content to the user based on the their needs and \nwants. Above all, experiential elements of the journey\u2014empathy, intuitive \ndecision paths, user validation, micro-feedback, and user delight\u2014are \nkept at the forefront while transaction processing happens seamlessly in \nthe background. This same focus should be placed on the agency-client \ncollaboration process. \n\nAs an agency, your clients are simply customers that embark on the \njourney of interacting with your various services and offerings. There are \ninternal company factors that affect the customer\u2019s journey, as well as \ntouchpoints within the agency that can trigger both positive and negative \nfeelings about the experience. One of the key trends driving digital \ndisruption is that customer expectations have changed to place a higher \nvalue on experiences. Agencies need to invest in ensuring the client\u2019s \njourney is one that is infused with positive experiences\u2014or risk becoming \na commodity that can be fulfilled by a number of other entities.  \n\n\n\nwhitepaper\n\nA CASE FOR DIGITAL ASSET MANAGEMENT IN AGENCIES 6\n\nThe Business Case\n\nThe business case for implementing DAM in the agency can be broken \ndown into three major categories: process efficiency, business agility, and \nrelationship fostering. \n\nProcess Efficiency\n\nProcess inefficiencies can inflate production costs and cause agency revenue \nleakage by not properly capturing the various components involved with \ncontent creation. Routing creative assets for review and capturing stakeholder \napproval are two of the hardest and most time-consuming elements of the \ncontent creation process. Versions can quickly get out of sync, annotations \ncome back in multiple formats that have to be consolidated, and valuable \ntime is squandered tracking down people and resources. By leveraging a \ncentralized and automated review process facilitated by a DAM system, \nagencies can easily streamline the creative process.\n\nBy leveraging a centralized and automated review process \nfacilitated by a DAM system, agencies can easily streamline \nthe creative process.\n\nFeatures can include real-time alerts to stakeholders that content is \nready for review, or tools to allow reviewers to conveniently provide their \nfeedback, centralizing the entire process. This way, everyone involved in \nthe review process is looking at the same asset and the same comments, \nkeeping everyone in sync. \n\nAnother key area that can be streamlined is the content syndication and \ndistribution process. Once agency content is approved, it typically needs \nto be made available to a variety of sources for distribution. The majority \nof the production work in getting content to the right channels and in the \nproper format can largely be automated using a DAM system. Business rules \ncan enable content to be automatically pushed to websites, e-commerce \napplications, mobile channels, and social media applications, ensuring the \ncorrect and most recent versions of content are being utilized. \n\n\n\nwhitepaper\n\nA CASE FOR DIGITAL ASSET MANAGEMENT IN AGENCIES 7\n\nBusiness Agility\n\nCurrent markets and digital innovations have created a modern \natmosphere that necessitates an ability to react to changes in an instant. \nDAM can help to avoid error to clients\u2019 last-minute requests.\n\nImage and media requests are a constant source of disruption and risk \nfor agencies. Many of these requests come in last-minute via phone or \nemail, and an informal process can lead to the request being delayed or \nentirely forgotten altogether. In addition, the requestors, typically not \nbeing media savvy, generally do not know the how to request the proper \nmedia format. Not delivering an asset request in a timely fashion or in the \nright format can quickly escalate and cause a variety of tensions between \nthe client and agency. By creating client self-service portals for image and \nmedia requests, agencies can easily automate this process and ensure the \ndelivery of the right media size and format based on the content usage. \nIn some cases, the implementation of an automated asset request-and-\nfulfillment capability can alone justify the costs associated with a DAM \nsystem and can even be a source of additional revenue for the agency. \n\nWithout a single-source repository, ensuring the client is accessing \nthe correct final-approved asset is nearly impossible. Because content \nin the process of being created can typically reside on any number \nof workstations or clouds, the risk of the wrong version being used is \nextremely high. DAM systems allow agencies to centralize all content \nstorage as well as safeguard and control versions. Ensuring current \nand correct content can also provide a number of business safeguards, \nincluding legal liability issues involved around improper usage.  \n\nWithout a single-source repository, ensuring the client is \naccessing the correct final-approved asset is nearly impossible.\n\n\n\nwhitepaper\n\nA CASE FOR DIGITAL ASSET MANAGEMENT IN AGENCIES 8\n\nManaging royalties and content usage rights can also safeguard \nagainst costly business mistakes.  Using a DAM system to set rules and \nnotifications around the syndication of content across all channels ensures \nusage rights are being adhered to and can mitigate these risks. Agencies \ncan also help clients avoid costs associated with paying usage or royalty \nfees on content that is not being utilized effectively, adding to their \nultimate bottom line. \n\nRelationship Fostering\n\nCommunication and transparency are critical to sustaining healthy agency-\nclient relationships. Efficient client communication and collaboration \nprocesses create convenience for busy clients that look to juggle multiple \ninitiatives simultaneously. Providing easy solutions for clients goes a \nlong way in fostering long-term relationships, and can even improve \nrelationships to the point where they become hard to sever. Leveraging \nthe power of DAM systems to create client\u2013integrated workflows will \nfacilitate a seamless collaboration between agency and client stakeholders.  \n\n\n\nwhitepaper\n\nA CASE FOR DIGITAL ASSET MANAGEMENT IN AGENCIES 9\n\nA Smart Content Hub \u2013 Not a Vault\n\nA DAM system isn\u2019t just the static storage archival repository. It needs to \nbe thought of as the central component for communication, collaboration, \nand distribution of content for an agency. Creative ideas and content are \nthe soul of agency culture. By enabling digitally convenient ways to interact \nwith your content, you add value to your agency in the eyes of the client, \nstrengthen your relationship with them and ingrain yourself in their journey. \n\nBe the source of inspiration for your clients. By making your content \neasily accessible, you\u2019ll be the first place they\u2019ll go when planning their \nnext project. \n\n\n\nwhitepaper\n\nA CASE FOR DIGITAL ASSET MANAGEMENT IN AGENCIES 10\n\nAbout SoftServe\n\nWith over 20 years of experience in digital software development and \nconsulting, SoftServe is a global leader in solving complex business \nproblems, creating industry disrupting technology and accelerating growth \nand innovation while optimizing operational efficiency.

The company is a \nmulti-solutions corporation that pro-\n\ncess all types of payments, including alter-\nnative payment solutions for e-commerce \nmerchants, debit and credit card processing \nservices, wallets, prepaid cards and vouch-\ners, direct debit payments, off-line pay-\nments support, and more. A sizeable part of \ntheir portfolio is a B2B segment. They offer \nturn-key solutions, integrating payments \nprocessing modules into enterprise systems \nthroughout various industries.\n\nBusiness Challenge\n\nOne of our clients major customers \n(merchant) was developing a new \nwebservice layer for their platform. \n\nThis new layer had already been connected \nto various competitor\u2019s payment partners. \nAlthough our client had one point of \nintegration with its customer\u2019s platform, its \ntechnology team were too slow to imple- \nment some of the payment processor risk \nmanagement product and features. This \nresulted in instances of authorization issues \nand transactions being declined. Our client \nwas at risk of losing its position of preferred \npartner with this customer.\n\nProject Description\n\nT he project required the development \nof a solution that integrated our client\u2019s \nmodules with the software from the \n\nclient partner\u2019s side.\n\nTo design the system properly during the \ndiscovery phase, SoftServe conducted \na series of workshops that included the \nfollowing activities: \n\n\u2022 An audit of the client\u2019s system, focusing \non architecture and security issues \n\n\u2022 A feasibility study of the integration of \nthe two systems \n\n\u2022 Mapping out the best way to integrate \nthe systems (architecture vision and \nsystems functional requirements issues)\n\n\u2022 Identifying limitations and best ap- \nproaches testing recommendations\n\nThe solution introduced by SoftServe is a  \nconnector integrating the client\u2019s processing \nsystem UI and their partner\u2019s input data \nsystem. When the merchant initiates a trans-\naction, it calls the SoftServe component and \ntransmits all the data about purchase/trans-\naction. The component transforms the trans-\naction information to make it compatible with \nclient\u2019s secure risk management feature. Then \nthe component calls the client\u2019s security  \nfeature API to submit the data from the \nmerchant. Thus, the transaction can be \nsecurely validated by the payment processor \nand completed.\n\nThe solution is fully hosted and supported \nby SoftServe, giving the client additional \noperational flexibility and internal resources \nfor other projects.\n\n5\n\n5\n\n5\n\n5\n\ncase study |    PCI Product Integration With Partner System for \n      Leading Payment Service Provider\n\n2\n\n\n\nFor the solution, it was crucial to satisfy \nseveral main parameters (quality attributes), \nsuch as reliability, security, and availability. \nSecurity is mainly supported via SSL (HTTPS), \nthe payment processor\u2019s product internally \nchecks and verifies the components for PCI \nstandard compliance. Availability represents, \nby default, a clustered environment with \nload balancer. Reliability is reached through \nguaranteed message delivery, messages \nprocessing, and proper error handling.\n\nSoftServe\u2019s solution successfully passed \nthe PCI DSS audit, required for developing a \nsolution that process cardholder data.\n\nTechnology Stack \n\nJava based\n\nValue Delivered\n\nImplementing the solution supported \nthe client\u2019s new enterprise partnership. \nThe main challenge of the project was \n\nthe risk of developing a solution to integrate \nwith an unfinished third-party component. \nNevertheless, the project was successfully \ndelivered on time and on budget. Benefits of \ncooperation included: \n\n\u2022 Deep analysis of the solution\u2019s architec-\ntural structure \n\n\u2022 Validation of the feasibility of the \nintegration request\n\n\u2022 A fully developed solution integrating \nthe client\u2019s payment system with the \npartner\u2019s services system \n\n\u2022 Proof of concept implementation to \ndecrease risks and costs before full \nscope system development \n\n\u2022 Hosting the solution and fully integrated \nprocesses after implementation \n\n\u2022 Taking the load from the in-house \nteam creating extra capacity for other \ninitiatives\n\n\u2022 Allowing the company IT department to \nfocus on things other than the mainte-\nnance of supportive products \n\nThe solution developed by SoftServe also \nenables our client\u2019s system to send void \nmessages concerning payment processing \nfrom any stage of the payment authen-\ntication process\u2014an additional market \nadvantage. \n\ncase study |    PCI Product Integration With Partner System for \n      Leading Payment Service Provider\n\n3\n\n\n\nABOUT US\nSoftServe is a digital authority that advises and provides at the \ncutting-edge of technology.

Another accountant \nopens the Exel file, accesses the ERP system, \nsearches the record of the first employee by \nthe employee code copied from the Excel file, \nopens the employee record and pastes there \nall new account data. Then they repeat the \nsame for all other records in the Excel file.\n\nThe process is important so that all necessary \npayments are performed using up-to-date infor-\nmation.

Then \ninternal IT teams were engaged to agree on \nthe solution architecture to integrate the au-\ntomation with internal systems.\n\nThe first step of the process was agreed as \nnot to be automated because of heightened \nsecurity in the bank access system and shorter \nduration of manual activities. The next step \nof the process to transfer Excel data to ERP \nwas fully automated. The only manual activi-\nty is to read the execution report and act on \nfailed updates, if any.

If not, \nnow would be a good time to lay out its elements one by one. The central idea of the \nbill is to speed up the approval process for drugs and devices. As John Mack, marketing \nblogger and pharmaceutical marketing expert explains: \u201cThe act is a way for the \npharmaceutical industry to get more drugs approved in a quicker and cheaper fashion\u201d.  \nMack who runs the blog pharma-mkting.com knows the pharmaceutical space well \nand has been analyzing US and global pharmaceutical affairs for many years. On July \n10, 2015, the bill passed the house and has now been sent to the Senate. As the US \n\nPrecision Medicine, and the \n21st Century Cures Act: \n5 Scenarios on the Future of \nthe Pharmaceutical Sector\n\nhttp://energycommerce.house.gov/sites/republicans.energycommerce.house.gov/files/114/20150429DiscussionDraft.pdf\nhttp://pharmamkting.blogspot.co.uk/\n\n\n2Precision Medicine, and the 21st Century Cures Act\n\nnational health innovation pipeline is working under increased pressure the National \nInstitutes of Health (NIH) is running on a historical funding low. In a campaign video \nDiana DeGette, a Democrat from Colorado who co-developed the draft, says that if \nlaws don\u2019t keep up with the pace of innovation we will all lose out. \n\nNIH\u2019s director Dr. Francis Collins has a great passion for precision medicine and when \nappearing at a round table at a medical school recently he said the funding situation \nat the NIH has driven the number of grants his organization is able to fund down by \nhalf and allowing it now to only approve 1 in 6 proposals (while the Guardian writes \nit could be as low as 5%, depending on institute). Now with this bill and its funding \npromise NIH\u2019s situation could dramatically change for the better. It would effectively \n\nbe able to build a serious NIH innovation fund \nand would allow more research and technology \nprojects to move into development. The act \npromises to provide an additional $2 billion per \nyear for 5 years.\n\nBut there is more. The implication and \nbackground of the bill is slightly larger and more \ncomplicated that one might hope for. The New \nYork Times writes that the bill aims at spurring \nbiomedical innovation, and wants to change the \nway federal health officials approve drugs and \nmedical devices. On the flipside, if the bill would \nfinally pass as legislation it would instructs the \nadministration to cover its costs by selling $8.75 \nbillion worth of oil from the US strategic federal \nreserve, which \u201cis not a piggy bank\u201d, as the New \nYork Times comments cynically. \n\n \n\nPrecision Medicine and the 21st Century Cures Act\nPrecision medicine is a program announced by the Obama administration last \nJanuary. With an already approved budget its official description says that it is an \nemerging approach for disease treatment and prevision which includes a patient\u2019s \nvariability in their genes, environment, and a person\u2019s lifestyle. \n\nWhat has the precision medicine initiative to do with the 21st Century Cures \nAct? Precision medicine would allow the inclusion of much more technology \n\n18+82+M\nGraphic: Bill passed the House \n\nwith 344 votes for and 77 against it\n\nVotes - 21 Century Cure Act (House)\n\n77 344\n\nFor Against\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3Dnv_wyTlfUDo%26feature%3Dyoutu.be\nhttps://www.genomeweb.com/policy-legislation/collins-and-varmus-outline-potential-precision-medicine-initiative-nejm\nhttp://www.mlive.com/news/kalamazoo/index.ssf/2015/07/fred_uptons_21st_century_cures.html\nhttp://www.theguardian.com/science/occams-corner/2015/jul/13/can-we-expect-a-miracle-for-biomedical-researchers-in-the-us\nhttp://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/11/us/politics/house-passes-product-of-unusual-bipartisan-partnership-on-health-care.html%3F_r%3D4\nhttp://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/11/us/politics/house-passes-product-of-unusual-bipartisan-partnership-on-health-care.html%3F_r%3D4\n\n\n3Precision Medicine, and the 21st Century Cures Act\n\ndriven healthcare innovation and would permit \nthe introduction of additional personal data and \ninformation into health science. The bill mentions and \ndefines precision medicine specifically again in the \nsection \u201cFDA Advancement of Precision Medicine\u201d as an \nadvanced analytical subset approach. \n\nIf you wonder how such diseases are identified, the \nbill mentions that this would occur via two possible \noptions. The first is via the genotype, or genotype \nin combination with other biological characteristics. \nThe second is via any other biological characteristic \nor means of identifying such a characteristic of the \ndisease. Under this definition, the secretary should be \nallowed to update the definition to whatever is needed \nto meet the criteria of a precision medicine drug in the \nfuture and would also be allowed to work much closer \nwith drug companies to meet the requirements. \n\nPharmaceutical Companies and the 21st Century Cures Act\n\nOne central questions remains. What would happen if the bill would really pass as a law \nand how would pharmaceutical companies respond? There are a few possible scenarios \nthat could result from the content currently written in the discussion draft. \n\n1. Increased Use of Biomarkers for Precision Medicine Drugs\n\nThe bill speaks specifically about allowing pharmaceutical companies to maximize \nthe use of scientific tools or methods to incorporate biomarkers into non-clinical and \nclinical development of a precision drug in order to evaluate how such drugs modify \nthe progression of diseases beyond well-established primary clinical endpoints (and \nidentifying such surrogate endpoints). With this in place, pharmaceutical companies \ncould determine the artificially calculated outcome endpoints without actually having \nto wait for the end of a trial. This saving in time could cause problems and John Mack \nis suspicious about it. He says the danger is that you might not see the final side \neffects, which may only come into force later after the patient has taken the drug for \nseveral months. As a result of this danger pharmaceutical companies may respond with \nsolutions to increase the reliability and safety of such endpoint calculations. But how? \n\n\u201cThe term \u2018precision medicine\u2019 or \u2018pre-\n\ncision drug\u2019 means a drug that, either \n\nalone or in combination with other \n\ntherapies, targets a subset of individuals \n\nwith a disease, which subset can be used \n\nto address the underlying cause of the \n\ndisease in order to modify the progres-\n\nsion of the disease, prevent the disease, \n\nor cure the disease\u201d.\n\n\n\n4Precision Medicine, and the 21st Century Cures Act\n\nThis is the billion dollar question. Monitoring software technology and personal \nmobile health applications for patients might be of great assistance in order to \nreduce the risk for trial patients.\n\n2. Even More R&D Investments Towards Personalized Medicine\n\nAccording to a report by Tufts Center for the Study of Drug Development, new \nresearch appeared that suggests the biopharmaceutical sector is making significant \nprogress in the personalized medicine space. The problem for this sector is that it \napparently still faces scientific, regulatory and reimbursement challenges regarding \nclinical adoption in its efforts to get targeted therapies approved. \n\nThe 21st Century Cures Act could help to remove these barriers. In the last 5 years, \nBiopharma companies have increased their research and development investments \ninto personalized medicine by almost 100% according to a paper by Genoweb. If the \nCures Act bill would really turn into law, the future investments could possibly even \nexceed the already expected increase of one-third for personalized medicine. \n\n3. More Collaborations Between Digital Technology Industry and the \nBiopharma Sector\n\nThe draft requires the formation of a board of appointed members. Two of 17 \nmembers should be from the information and digital technology industry and four \nmembers are supposed to originate from the biopharmaceutical space. Although \na bit of an unequal distribution the bill might drive collaboration between the \ntechnology and the biopharmaceutical sectors, as both sectors would now sit on \nthe same table. In response to challenges around the data privacy debate for the \nbill, the technology sector might also bring their solutions to the table. Fierce Health \nIT wrote about unanswered privacy questions the bill causes.  In particular, two \nsections in the bill would be of great concern. One is that it would make it easier \nfor researchers to be able to access information to develop study protocols while \nmaking that process available electronically. The bill would also allow patients to give \nconsent for their data to be used for future research, and not just for one study alone. \nThe pharmaceutical sector and representatives from the technology industry, in \ncollaboration with patient privacy advocates, would need to come up with a solution \nfor how to respond to these question marks with clear and transparent strategies. \nThe technology industry had to find solutions for similar challenges previously in \nother sectors such as banking and retail. The pharmaceutical and the research sectors \nmight possibly be able to leverage knowhow gained by the tech sector by working \ncloser together.\n\nhttp://csdd.tufts.edu/\nhttps://www.genomeweb.com/sites/default/files/public/downloads/news/pmc-phrma-personalized-medicine-investment.pdf\nhttp://www.fiercehealthit.com/story/21st-century-cures-act-raises-privacy-questions/2015-07-21\nhttp://www.fiercehealthit.com/story/21st-century-cures-act-raises-privacy-questions/2015-07-21\n\n\n5Precision Medicine, and the 21st Century Cures Act\n\n 4. More Health Initiatives with the Word \u201cPrecision\u201d in the Title\nJust recently, the US National Cancer Institute  (NCI) launched the Precision Cancer \nInitiative and with it, its NCI-MATCH trial. It enables more information to be identified \nfor particular cancers based on signals the research finds in molecular profiling from \nthe trial. The initiative allows additional clinical trials to be undertaken for precision \nmedicine drugs for oncology. The NCI writes on their website that oncology would be \na natural choice as precision medicine would concentrate mainly on genes. Cancers \nwould be a disease of the genome and a suitable first choice. Once the bill passes \nmore precision medicine clinical trials could follow and with it more initiatives that \nuse genome research for additional diseases. \n\n5. Drug Development for Children with Rare Diseases\n\nLisa Gillespie writes in a KHN piece that advocates say more research needs to be \nconducted with children, that there is a shortage of good therapies for rare and often \ndeadly pediatric diseases and that children would miss out on having access to pediatric \nspecific drugs (particularly in the rare disease category). The bill would extend the \nnational pediatric drug voucher program, Gillespie writes. On the flipside, it would do so \nonly for an additional three years. This would not be enough for drug companies, which \ngenerally need 10 years or more to win investors over to grant research projects for \n\n12+12+12+12+12+23+17+M\nGraphic: 2 of the 17 members would represent the digital technology industry\n\nAppointed Members (21 Century Cure Act)\n\n11.8 % 11.8 %\n\n11.8 %\n\n11.8 %\n\n11.8 %\n\n23.5 %\n\n17.6 %\n\nRepresentatives of the information \n\nand digital technology industry\n\nRepresentatives of academic \n\nresearchers\n\nRepresentatives of healthcare \n\nproviders\n\nRepresentatives of the medical \n\ndevice industry\n\nRepresentatives of healthcare \n\nplans and insurers\n\nRepresentatives of patients\n\nRepresentatives of the \n\nbiopharmaceutical industry\n\nhttp://www.cancer.gov/research/key-initiatives/precision-medicine\nhttp://khn.org/news/bill-to-speed-fda-approvals-includes-rewards-for-drugs-designed-for-kids/%3Futm_content%3Dbuffer46ff0%26utm_medium%3Dsocial%26utm_source%3Dtwitter.com%26utm_campaign%3Dbuffer\n\n\n6Precision Medicine, and the 21st Century Cures Act\n\nnew drugs. After all, if the bill doesn\u2019t permit a longer extension for the pediatric drug \nvoucher program the economic incentives may not be there to boost drug development \nfor children with rare diseases. If this is understood correctly by policy makers they \nwould do well to consider an amendment to this part of the bill at some point.  \n\nPro and Cons of the Bill\n\nThe mentioning of precision medicine \nin the bill is far-reaching and could \naffect the pharmaceutical, research and \nhealthcare hospital sectors significantly. \nWith advocates for the bill on one side, \nsuch as Cresent Hardy, representative \nof Nevada\u2018s 4th Congressional District, \nthere is also a determined set of people \nwho have criticized the bill vehemently. \nOne is Dr. Jerry Avorn, a professor at \n\nHarvard Medical School who calls the bill a Trojan horse. Hardy says it is a $12 billion \nsaving opportunity. \n\nHardy writes that the bill would keep jobs in the US. It would also reduce the deficit \nby $500 million and would increase chances to find cures for the 7,000 rare diseases \nwhich he thinks currently lack economic incentives to be looked at. \n\nIn an interview published on the website of the New England Journal Dr. Avorn says \nthat the pace of the drug approval process wasn\u2019t a problem in the first place. \u201cFor \nthe FDA it takes between 6 and 10 months to take a completed dossier a company \nprovides and to turn it into a commonly informative decision on a drug. There is not \na problem with the speed in the drug approvals today\u201d, he says. But a whitepaper by \nthe FDA says that the agency would be the fastest drug review agency in the world.\n\nAvron is most concerned with the lowering of standards the bill suggests, and how \napprovals could be based on biomarkers instead of outcome, essentially opening \npossibilities for drug makers to disregard the current gold-standard for clinical trials. \n\u201cIt is not always the case that relying on biomarkers is going to be a good way to \nbring new drugs to market if they replace more conventional assessments of patients \nbenefit\u201d, he says. \n\nBesides the criticism one has to recognize that already early on in the development \nprocess the 21st Century Cures initiative managed to receive significant support by \ncredible medical bodies such as the American Medical Association (which helped \nto outline reforms for the bill in areas such as tele- and personalized medicine, \nantibiotics development, EHRs and the protection of patient data). \n\nhttp://www.fda.gov/ForIndustry/DevelopingProductsforRareDiseasesConditions/RarePediatricDiseasePriorityVoucherProgram/default.htm\nhttp://www.fda.gov/ForIndustry/DevelopingProductsforRareDiseasesConditions/RarePediatricDiseasePriorityVoucherProgram/default.htm\nhttp://www.reviewjournal.com/news/21st-century-cures-act-will-save-lives-money\nhttp://www.nejm.org/action/showMediaPlayer%3Fdoi%3D10.1056%252FNEJMp1506964%26aid%3DNEJMp1506964_attach_1%26area%3D%26viewType%3DPopup%26viewClass%3DAudio%26%26\nhttp://www.fda.gov/AboutFDA/ReportsManualsForms/Reports/ucm439082.htm\nhttp://www.ama-assn.org/ama/pub/advocacy/topics/21st-century-medical-innovations.page\n\n\n7Precision Medicine, and the 21st Century Cures Act\n\nWhich parties would gain most in the end would only be clear after it had passed \nall legal stages. It\u2019s clear is that the bill could force more sectors to work closer \ntogether and that might be not a bad thing. The technology industry could become \nan important ally for the biopharmaceutical space and we would expect to see more \ncollaboration between these two very different sectors if this bill is successfully \nimplemented.\n\nThe Emergence of New Technologies If the Act Passes \n\nDigital health is now JUST health and understanding bits and bytes \nis key to the technology organizations \u2013 but are they ready?\n\nFor the technology sector this act could be a real blessing. To the question of whether \nthe US healthcare market would all of the sudden be swamped with new health \ntechnology applications if the act passes, John Mack explains that the bill already \ntalks about telemedicine and that pharmaceutical companies would possibly gain a \nlot more confidence in developing, supporting and sponsoring these kinds of health \napplications. \u201cI am not completely sure whether that is the kind of business the \npharmaceutical companies would explore alone\u201d, he says in the interview. \n\nIn fact more pharmaceutical companies have started to consider working with \ntechnology companies. A PWC report also mentions that access to patient data will \nraise the stakes of the game and that the convergence of technology and market \nforces in healthcare will make patient data a powerful factor in the cost/benefit \nequation. If US pharmaceutical companies would really want to venture out on their \nown they would need to understand every bit and bite of the technology they want \nto use, how its data can be protected and the impact on patients.  We are particularly \nlikely to see a response from pharmaceutical companies in terms of data protection. \nAs health data breaches increase - some surveys suggest that nearly half of all \nbreaches took place in healthcare in 2014 \u2013 the pharmaceutical companies would \nreally need to find ways to protect data effectively and they likely won\u2019t come up with \na solution all by themselves.\n\nPersonalized in \u201cpersonalized medicine\u201d means more security and \nregulation\n\nFurther Mack says that there are lots of other technological companies already out \nthere, including Apple and Google, developing apps that connect to devices with a \nhealthcare purpose. \u201cThese companies don\u2019t want to go through the expense to get \nFDA approval and the act is mainly focused on helping them not to have to go the \n\nhttp://www.pwc.com/us/en/health-industries/top-health-industry-issues/drug-prices.html\nhttp://nuviun.com/content/digital-health-cyber-threats-study-to-examine-data-breaches\n\n\n8Precision Medicine, and the 21st Century Cures Act\n\ndifficult way of navigating through usual FDA regulations\u201d, he says. With the act and \nthese new applications, personal medicine would emerge. Now, not only Apple and \nIBM are playing this game but also pharmaceutical giants such as Merck are in for the \nwin. Back in 2012 the company was a leading investor in health technology startups \naccording to the US health startup accelerator RockHealth and the act could cause \nmore investments to flow into seed level health technology projects. \n\nWith more personalized medicine on the US market would this mean more \nregulations too? The FDA defines personalized medicine as precision medicine and a \nway to tailor medical treatments to the individual characteristics. If the bill would now \nallow more health technologies in personal medicine the act would trigger a whole \nlot of new regulations. In fact a whole chapter in the H.R.6 text is dedicated to ruling \nthe sensible oversight for technology, which advances regulatory efficiency.\n\nBig data will only get bigger \u2013 are you ready pharma?\n\nFinally, what about big data you may \nask. Big data is another great reason \nfor pharmaceutical companies to seek \nsupport and collaboration with the \ntechnology sector if the bill happens to \npass. The big challenge is no longer just \nto sequence a human\u2019s genome. Instead \nthe trouble comes from organizing the \ndata value chain effectively and store \nthe data. Technology companies such \nas Tute Genomics create cloud-based \n\nsolutions for precision genome-guided medicine. How to get such information \nanalyzed as quickly as possible and then stored, protected and connected to \noutcome? It\u2019s the billion-dollar question. \n\nFor genomic information alone, even at the moment medical research faces major \nproblems in doing it on a small scale and working with healthcare providers \neffectively. Now imagine what could happen if every trial patient would be connected \nand monitored in real time. The data volume would explode, and the act could help \nto do exactly that. \n\nPharmaceutical companies such as Roche already work in other parts of the world \nwith mobile tech and personal monitoring technologies. The company\u2019s latest \nannouncement revealed that it intends to start using a Samsung Galaxy S3 Mini \nsmartphones during a phase I drug trial to track Parkinson\u2019s disease patients\u2019 \nsymptoms. If the act would pass, we are likely to see a lot more similar trials in the US.\n\nhttp://health.spectator.co.uk/apple-and-ibm-may-just-have-changed-the-future-of-personalised-medicine/\nhttp://health.spectator.co.uk/apple-and-ibm-may-just-have-changed-the-future-of-personalised-medicine/\nhttp://www.merck.com/index.html\nhttp://www.forbes.com/sites/zinamoukheiber/2013/01/07/merck-emerges-as-top-funder-of-digital-health-start-ups/\nhttps://www.congress.gov/bill/114th-congress/house-bill/6/text\nhttps://www.tutegenomics.com/about\nhttp://nuviun.com/content/The-Problem-Medical-Research-Has-With-Genomics\nhttp://www.biopharmadive.com/news/tracking-parkinsons-patients-for-a-drug-trial-roche-has-an-app-for-that/404027/\nhttp://www.biopharmadive.com/news/tracking-parkinsons-patients-for-a-drug-trial-roche-has-an-app-for-that/404027/\n\n\nUSA HQ\nToll Free: 866-687-3588 \nTel: +1-512-516-8880 \n\nUkraine HQ\nTel: +380-32-240-9090 \n\nBulgaria \nTel: +359-2-902-3760\n\nGermany\nTel: +49-69-2602-5857\n\nNetherlands\nTel: +31-20-262-33-23 \n\nPoland\nTel: +48-71-382-2800\n\nSweden\nTel: +46-844-685-084\n\nUK\nTel: +44-207-544-8414\n \n\nEMAIL\ninfo@softserveinc.com\n\nWEBSITE:\nwww.softserveinc.com\n\nAbout SoftServe\n\nSoftServe is a leading technology solutions company specializing in software \ndevelopment and consultancy services.

Based on these opportunities for \noperational savings, our client agreed to \na pilot program to implement two critical \nbusiness operational dashboards.  \n\nThese pilot dashboards required building \nout the core business intelligence \ninfrastructure and pipelines while \ndefining and vetting key standards for \ntools. SoftServe had included these \ndashboards in the early stage of the data \nstrategy roadmap to replace the client\u2019s \nunwieldy Excel spreadsheets.  \n\nOnce our experts built these new \noperational dashboards, it eliminated \nthe previous spreadsheets\u2019 manual and \nmulti-day data collection and preparation \nwork. Instead of only weekly updates, the \nentire organization can now access the \ninformation decision-makers need in real-\ntime. The change was so dramatic that one \nof the company\u2019s financial analysts called \nthese dashboards a \u201cgame-changer.\u201d \n\nNow our client has key data and analytics \ninfrastructure components in place and \nthe ability to access critical operational \ndata and analytics immediately. With this \nfoundation, they can focus on moving \nforward with their long-term business \nintelligence and analytics goals, with \na path laid out by SoftServe in their \ncustomized data strategy roadmap. With \nthe infrastructure, strategy, and systems \nin place, our client is well on their way to \nrealizing both $50M+ in operational savings \nand their AI/ML goals. \n\nBuilding and growing an enterprise requires \nforward thinking, strategy, and a deep \nindustry knowledge, but to truly expand, \nyou must be data-driven.  \n\nLET\u2019S TALK about how SoftServe can \ntransform your business intelligence, \nstreamline and optimize operational costs, \nand enable data-driven success within the \nagricultural industry.\n\ncase study |    Accelerating Business Growth with a Comprehensive Data Strategy Roadmap 3\n\nhttps://www.softserveinc.com/en-us/contact\n\n\nABOUT SOFTSERVE\n\nWe are a digital authority made up of advisors, engineers, and designers \nwho deliver innovation, quality, and speed to elevate and accelerate our \nclients\u2019 digital journeys.\n\nOur approach is built on a foundation of empathetic, human-focused \nexperience design that ensures value and continuity from concept to \nrelease.\n\nWE IDENTIFY WHERE YOU ARE.                   \nWE PREPARE YOU FOR THE ROAD AHEAD.\u00a0 \nWE TAKE YOU WHERE YOU NEED TO GO.\u00a0\nVisit our website, blog, LinkedIn, Facebook, and Twitter pages.\n\nNORTH AMERICAN HQ\n\n201 W 5th Street, Suite 1550 \nAustin, TX 78701 \nUSA +1 866 687 3588 (USA)           \n+1 647 948 7638 (Canada) \n\nEUROPEAN HQ\n\n30 Cannon Street\nLondon EC4M 6XH\nUnited Kingdom  \n+44 333 006 4341\n\ninfo@softserveinc.com \nwww.softserveinc.com\n\n\n", "LocationURL": "https://www.softserveinc.com/files/cases/accelerating-business-growth-with-a-comprehensive-data-strategy-roadmap.pdf", "id": "sw-rf-811", "FileName": "accelerating-business-growth-with-a-comprehensive-data-strategy-roadmap.pdf", "Storage": "SoftServe Website", "Published": "2022-01-11T11:59:37Z", "FileType": ".pdf"}, {"Category": null, "content": "\nImprove Corrosion Management and \nEnsure Asset Integrity with Computer \nVision and Machine Learning\n\nCASE \nSTUDY\n\n\n\nT    he oil and gas sector is challenged with coating breakdown and corrosion detection \nacross the entire asset management lifecycle. Energy companies lose billions of dol-\nlars annually due to damage caused by ineffective asset integrity management. Oil \n\nand gas industry leaders can mitigate the problem by moving from reactive to proactive \nasset maintenance to prevent asset failure and downtime, lower maintenance costs, and \nensure employee and environmental safety. \n\nDiscover how to apply advanced technologies to proactively monitor for corrosion, screen \nfor anomalies, and detect additional defects. \n\nApproach for Labeling Panorama\n\ncase study Improve Corrosion Management and Ensure Asset  \nIntegrity with Computer Vision and Machine Learning\n\n2\n\n\n\nTHE PINNACLE \nSUCCESS STORY\n\nO ur client, Pinnacle, is a leader in \ndeveloping data-driven solutions for \nthe oil and gas, chemical, mining, \n\nand water and wastewater industries. The \ncompany helps industrial facilities better \nleverage their data to ensure increased pro-\nduction, optimized maintenance spending, \nand improvements in process safety and \nenvironmental impact.  \n\nPinnacle is focused on helping its customers \nmanage risks, optimize costs, and ensure \ncompliance through its Data-Driven \nReliability framework. This framework \nconsists of four categories: data collection, \norganization, intelligence, and strategic \ndecisions. Pinnacle\u2019s Research and \nDevelopment team continues to invest in \nthe intelligence segment of this framework, \nspecifically through Quantitative \nReliability Optimization (QRO), to deliver \ndata-driven insights for its clients.\n\nData collection and organization are \namong Pinnacle's strong points, and their \nclients can confidently make strategic \ndecisions. However, they wanted to \nfurther help their customers create \nrobust data reliability programs.  \n\nPinnacle wanted to embrace cutting-edge \ntechnology and directly link data collection \nand intelligence segments in one solution. \nRecognizing they needed edge technology \nexpertise, Pinnacle reached out to \nSoftServe. SoftServe was asked to prove \nthe feasibility and validate the business \nvalue of a computer-vision based approach \nfor detecting and classifying coating \nanomalies and corrosion using visual data. \n\nCorrosion Segmentation Results \n\nCORROSION \n\nSTAINS\n\ncase study Improve Corrosion Management and Ensure Asset  \nIntegrity with Computer Vision and Machine Learning\n\n3\n\nhttps://pinnaclereliability.com\n\n\nOUR APPROACH \n\nS oftServe\u2019s experts helped Pinnacle \ndevelop effective ML models for \ncorrosion segmentation and texture \n\nclassification. The final model can generate \ncoating breakdown and corrosion maps, \nevaluate damaged areas, and mark corro-\nsion damage according to a few severity \nclasses. \n\nWe conducted several experiments to ex-\namine the problem from a different angle \nto help determine the best solution for the \nclient. We tried using open-source data and \na classifier based on embedding vectors, \nbut the metrics were worse. Since there \naren\u2019t many open-source textural datasets, \nwe decided to gather our own big datasets \nwith specific textures.  \n\nPinnacle provided panoramic images con-\nverted to a 2D view suitable for labeling \npurposes. SoftServe\u2019s experts, in collabora-\ntion with the Pinnacle team, conducted the \nlabeling workshop and developed image \nanalytics to evaluate distribution, calculate \nstatistics of coating damage and corrosion, \netc. The labels for the datasets were: \n\n\u2022 Corrosion segmentation:  \ncorrosion and stains.  \n\n\u2022 Texture classification:  \nsevere corrosion, light corrosion, paint \ndefects, rust staining, and normal paint. \n\nWe split the dataset of images into three \nparts: training, validation, and testing for \nboth corrosion segmentation and texture \nclassification. \n\nThe texture classification solution uses the \nsliding window approach and classifies the \ncrops of an image with the size of 128 px x \n128px. This size showed the best result in \nour previous experiments compared to oth-\ner tested sizes. During experiments with the \nsupervised and unsupervised classification \nof the textures, we tested the most pop-\nular machine learning algorithms, such as \nXGBoost, K-NN, Centroid-based, SVC, plus \nothers. We decided to use ResNet18 as a fi-\nnal model for texture classification because \nit gave the best data results.   \n\nFor corrosion segmentation, we tested sev-\neral fully convolutional networks with the \nUNet-like architectures. During the hyperpa-\nrameter tuning process, we tested several \nparameters of the segmentation pipeline \nsuch as model architecture, model encoder, \nloss function, number of epochs, batch size, \ninput size, and image input method. This \nallowed us to find the optimal configuration \nof the pipeline. In the final implementation, \nwe used the PSPNet architecture and an \nEfficientNet encoder.\n\ncase study Improve Corrosion Management and Ensure Asset  \nIntegrity with Computer Vision and Machine Learning\n\n4\n\n\n\nCorrosion Severity Levels on Images \n\nCORROSION  \nINFERENCE PIPELINE\nClose-up image inference\n\nPanoramic image inference\n\nCORROSION SEGMENTATION ORIGINAL TEXTURE CLASSIFICATION\n\nNORMAL\u00a0PAINT\n\nPAINT\u00a0DEFECTS\n\nRUST\u00a0STAINING\u00a0\n\nLIGHT\u00a0CORROSION\n\nSEVERE\u00a0CORROSION\n\nSplit to 14  \nregular images\n\nCORROSION \n\nSTAINS\n\nPANORAMA IMAGE\n\nREGULAR IMAGE\n\nREGULAR IMAGE\n\n...\n\nREGULAR IMAGE\n\nCorrosion \nsegmentation\n\nTextures \nclassification\n\nREGULAR IMAGE \nCORROSION MASK\n\n...\n\nCORROSION AND \nSTAINS MASK\n\nConnect 14 regular masks \ninto panoramic mask\n\nREGULAR IMAGE \nTEXTURE MASK\n\nREGULAR IMAGE \nTEXTURE MASK\n\n...\n\nREGULAR IMAGE \nTEXTURE MASK\n\nConnect 14 regular \nmasks into panoramic \n\ntextures mask\n\nCorrosion \nsegmentation\n\nTextures \nclassification\n\nCORROSION AND \nSTAINS MASK\n\nCORROSION AND \nSTAINS MASK\n\nCORROSION AND \nSTAINS MASK\n\nPANORAMA IMAGE\n\nREGULAR IMAGE \nCORROSION MASK\n\nREGULAR IMAGE \nCORROSION MASK\n\ncase study Improve Corrosion Management and Ensure Asset  \nIntegrity with Computer Vision and Machine Learning\n\n5\n\n\n\nHeatmap view \n\nBrowser application \n\nSOLUTION OUTCOMES \nTogether with Pinnacle, the SoftServe team successfully  \ncompleted the following project deliverables:   \n\n\u2022 CORROSION SEGMENTATION ML \nMODEL.

The platform also demonstrated \nCisco solutions integration possibilities with the popular Automation and Orchestration \nInfrastructure as Code (IAC) tools, along with infrastructure and application awareness set-\nup. SoftServe also shared hybrid cloud development models with Cisco.\n\nThe SoftServe team also recommended a sample modern application to proof the demo \nplatform capabilities. In addition SoftServe worked with a small team from Cisco to design \na hybrid cloud use case. \n\nThe Implementation phase focused on the demo platform implementation, with the \ntechnical demo flow being divided into separate sub-phases: \n\n\u2022 Infrastructure provisioning \n\n\u2022 Continuous integration and continuous delivery \n\n\u2022 Continuous delivery (CD) process monitoring and compliance\n\nMonitoring data correlations  \nand actions with Splunk\n\nGlobal availability monitoring  \nwith Cisco ThousandEyes\n\nInfrastructure and application  \nlevel monitoring with AppDynamics\n\nWorkload optimization with Cisco IWO\n\nNetworking integrity monitoring and  \nsecurity enforcement with Cisco NDI\n\nCisco IWO\n\nCisco NDI\nCisco NDO APIC\n\nNetwork and Sucurity layer\n\nInfrastructure layer\n\nApplication layer\n\nApplication on VMs Application in K8S\n\nBare-matal DB VMs Clod infrastructure Kubernetes\n\ncase study |   Cisco UKI Demo Lab 5\n\n\n\nW ith the successful creation of the Cisco Demo Platform at Cisco Bedfont Lakes and \nthe completion of the project in early June 2022, Cisco can now demonstrate their \nability to support cloud-native workloads, application modernization customer \n\njourneys, and hybrid cloud deployment models. Cisco can also demonstrate the ability \nto separate technical flow into infrastructure provisioning, continuous integration and \ndelivery, and CD process monitoring and compliance. \n\nThis success also meets Cisco\u2019s desire to provide and expand demos for its varied customer \nstakeholders, including IT teams, engineering, and application teams. \n\nSaid one Cisco team member who was engaged in the project, \n\nConclusion  \n\nAs Cisco\u2019s Customers and Partners embrace \nthe Hybrid Cloud as their platform for \nmodern digital business, the importance \nof how applications and infrastructure \ninteract has never been more critical. The \nability to provide business observability \nand insight into these infrastructures and \nrapidly deploy and adapt resources is now \nconsidered an essential part of a Cloud \nOperating Model. \n\nHowever, this can only be achieved by \nbringing all these elements together in \na unified operating approach.

Elements of \nthe top-down approach can be incorporated here, but the core focus is \non the systems already in place and not creating new systems to solve \nthe challenge of deriving value from Big Data sets. \n\nThe key differences here between the bottom-up and top-down \napproaches are that with this foundational approach the focus is on \nsystems and functions while the top-down approach focuses on users and \ntheir respective skill sets. \n\nBottom-up approach Top-down approach\n\nsystems and \nfunctions \n\nusers and \ntheir skill sets\n\n\n\nebook\n\nDISCOVERING THE VALUE OF BIG DATA IN TODAY\u2019S MODERN ENTERPRISE 6\n\nBuilding on the Fundamentals of \nBusiness Analytics\n\nExternal experts, like SoftServe, may be helpful \nto provide third party perspective and guide your \norganization through ideation and discovery \nsessions, conducting proof of concept and \nvalidation, as well as conduct interviews with \ngroup stakeholders. \n\nThe success of a Big Data \nprogram is contingent upon the \nfoundation of a strong business \nanalytics program.

For instance, businesses require daily credit risk frameworks and what-if \nscenario testing, where traditionally they were only monitored monthly.\n\nSo in a fast-paced environment, how do you ensure your business is making the right \nfinancial decisions?\n\nLet\u2019s consider application scorecards as a typical challenge in credit risk modeling, and \nthe practical steps necessary for success.\n\nApplication Scoring\n\nAn application scorecard is a statistic-based analysis of the client\u2019s creditworthiness \nbased on applicant and loan information. It belongs to credit risk strategy and modeling \n(in retail, lending business), and is directly associated with the PD, or probability of \ndefault. PD is one of the key parameters in regulatory reporting and measuring capital \nadequacy for banking institutions according to Basel II and Basel III. Therefore, the \nhigher the score, the lower the PD. The scorecard is presented as a set of characteristics \nand points corresponding to them:\n\nFINANCIAL RISK\n\nMarket RiskCounterparty Liquidity Risk\n\nCash flowsPartners\n\nFinancingCredit\n\nCommodity FX\n\nInterest\n\n\n\nwhitepaper | Credit Risk: Assess PD with an Application Scorecard 3\n\nTo calculate a customer\u2019s score, you simply add the characteristic points associated with \nthe customer\u2019s application. This makes the scorecard time-consuming to build, but easy to \ndeploy, integrate, and use.\n\nAPPLICATION SCORECARD\n\nCharacteristic Attribute Score\n\nCredit history Good 51\n\n Bad 0\n\n N/A 15\n\nLoan amount 100..1500 81\n\n 1500..2300 49\n\n 2300..3500 41\n\n 3500..8000 23\n\n 8000+ 0\n\nNumber of dependents 0..0 0\n\n 1..2 25\n\n 3+ 12\n\nAge 18..24 0\n\n 25..29 22\n\n 30..39 33\n\n 40..55 39\n\n 55+ 47\n\nIncome (monthly) 0..550 0\n\n 550..1300 10\n\n 1300..2800 22\n\n 2800..4500 48\n\n 4500..8000 67\n\n 8000+ 62\n\n\n\nwhitepaper | Credit Risk: Assess PD with an Application Scorecard 4\n\nBut maybe you\u2019re asking yourself: Why do we need to build a scorecard?\n\nLet\u2019s examine the benefits.\n\nMotivation\n\nThe first benefit of using a scorecard is reducing the delinquency rate\u2014a good scorecard \nhelps to distinguish good and bad users efficiently.\n\nThe second benefit is risk assessment. It enables you to predict your cash flow or P&L \n(profit and loss), and to reserve a valid amount of funds with respect to the risk associated \nwith the portfolio. \n\nA significant speed-up of the application process is another meaningful effect of the \nscorecard application, giving you results in minutes\u2014not hours or even days. \n\nThere\u2019s also the possibility of a risk-based pricing approach integration, when low-risk \ncustomers receive better rates and vice versa. \n\nThe requirements satisfaction and internal fraud monitoring are among other \nincluded benefits, allowing you to get a better read on your customers and to keep an eye \non any suspicious activity.\n\nRefer\n\nReject Accept\n\n190 210 4000\n\nScore\n\n\n\nwhitepaper | Credit Risk: Assess PD with an Application Scorecard 5\n\nBuilding the Scorecard\n\nSo how do you build it? Let\u2019s consider the steps needed to build an application scorecard. \n\nThe first step of the approach is to assume that the customer\u2019s behavior will remain \nconsistent with the historical data, allowing you to predict creditworthiness based on \npast experience. To extract this \u201cexperience\u201d we\u2019ll need the historical data from previous \nloans. Get the data, validate the quality, and make sure you have enough of it (for a stable \nscorecard, at least 2,000 records are recommended), then prepare and clean it for\nfurther analysis. Anomaly detection and missing value treatment are also parts of this\npre-processing step. If applicable, credit bureau data should also be gathered; social \nmedia data is also a modern source of additional data. Usually, the analysis is done in \nSAS/R/SPSS/Python, and the data is extracted from the SQL or other database.\n\nThe second thing to do is determine the observation period: defining \u201cbad\u201d/\u201ddefault\u201d \ndebt so that the task is transformed into mathematical language: a binary classification \nproblem, to identify whether a new customer will return the loan or not. Typically, \npayments for 60 to 90 days (conservative approach) past due are treated as defaults.\n\nThirdly, you must perform data analysis\u2014categorizing continuous variables, their \ncorrelations and filtrations, segmentation, and then separating the dataset into training, \nvalidation, and test subsets. This is a significant part of the scorecard development process. \nThe same toolset is used\u2014SAS/R/SPSS/Python or, more unusually, custom software. \n\nNext, you start modeling. Usually, logistic regression is under the hood, sometimes \ndecision trees, rarely Artificial Neural Networks (because this algorithm is a \u201cblack-box\u201d \nin terms of interpretation). Modeling is followed by a model assessment, which includes \nmultiple steps and visualizations (e.g. Gini coefficient and ROC-curve, confusion matrices \nto assess both precision and stability), choosing, and boosting. \n\nAfter completing the above and, typically, some expert adjustment, you\u2019re able to make \na PD prediction. Everything you need to generate a scorecard from the model\u2014simply \nselect a scale and perform a PD-to-score transformation. Risk buckets and cut-off \nselection are done at this stage as well, including the optional formation of high-level \nrecommendations for a risk-based credit policy according to the business goals. \n\n\n\nwhitepaper | Credit Risk: Assess PD with an Application Scorecard 6\n\nFinalization\n\nWe\u2019ve covered the definition of the application scorecard, motivation\u2014why we need it, and \nthe major steps of the scorecard development process. Let's explore where it fits in your \noverall strategy.\n\nA good scorecard is used as a part or module of the overall credit strategy and process, not \nas a standalone product. Moreover, to ensure the effectiveness of the scorecard over time, \nthe corresponding monitoring framework and alerts system must be built. \n\nAdditionally, regular performance checks should be conducted at least once in a quarter to \nverify if any adjustments or even a model rebuild are needed.\n\nConclusion\n\nIn this paper, we\u2019ve outlined the process of building an application scorecard as a typical \ntask of credit risk management as well as the main steps of this process in detail, from \ngetting historical data to modeling to monitoring. Assessing PD helps you run your business \nmore efficiently, monitor the portfolio and profitability, and to make wise choices when it \ncomes to your bottom line.\n\nAt SoftServe, we have a robust engineering background, experience in building distributed \nand computational-effective systems, and subject matter experts and analysts.

One of \nthe tools developed and implemented for their partners is the ATC Online Application Tool, \na bespoke online solution that enables companies/organizations to apply to become an \nAutodesk Authorized Training Center (ATC). Engage Global Solutions created the tool to \nimprove the customer experience when applying to the ATC Program, increase visibility \nand applications tracking, and automate the manual work originally required to process \napplications.\n\nAlthough the ATC Online Application Tool was initially launched in just a few countries, it \nwill eventually be distributed globally. Therefore, Engage needed to find a solution to:\n\n\u2022 Accommodate scalability\n\u2022 Handle fluctuations in traffic to the Online Application Tool website\n\u2022 Save costs by moving away from expensive dedicated storage\n\u2022 Enhance security and availability of the tool.\n\nIn order to achieve their goals, Engage decided to migrate one of their key tools from the \nexisting environment to the Cloud. However, the tool was hosted on a complex server \nenvironment comprised of two mirrored servers with four virtual machines (TEST, BACKUP, \nUAT and PRODUCTION).\n\nIt was evident that the complicated structure and size of the servers in this environment \nwould create a significant technical challenge, so Engage chose to work with their \nlongstanding partner SoftServe.\n\n\u201cThe SoftServe\u2019s team was already familiar with our server environment as they have \nsuccessfully worked on tasks and problem solutions on this tool in the past, so we were \nconfident they were the right partner to deliver a successful solution within a very tight \ntimeframe,\u201d said Rickard Lautrup, Global Projects Manager, Engage Global Solutions Ltd.\n\nProject Description\n\nTo help Engage achieve their business and technical goals, the SoftServe and Engage teams \nconducted a comprehensive analysis of different platform providers and selected Amazon \nWeb Services (AWS) cloud computing platform offering the best combination of cost \nefficiency and suitability for the production environment.\n\nThis platform allowed the team to deliver a solution that met the business goals within one \nmonth.\n\n\n\ncase study |    Tool Migration to AWS Cloud Computing Platform for Engage 3\n\nThe tool from Engage was hosted in the AWS Cloud with the following features:     \n\n\u2022 Autoscaling\n\u2022 Monitoring solution\n\u2022 Backup solution \n\u2022 Disaster recovery plan\n\nUAT, TEST, Backup environments were hosted in the AWS Cloud\n\nAn operation plan was created and the solution was deployed for all 4 environments.

Our best architects and analysts had the amazing chance to talk to \nmany retail industry leaders, discussing the top challenges and issues they experience \ntoday both digitally and in general.\n\nSee below the top challenges\u2014and suggested solutions\u2014that we\u2019ve compiled, based on \nfeedback from retail industry experts and our own technology expertise.\n\n1. Competition with Amazon and the \u201cretail apocalypse\u201d\n\nChallenge: It\u2019s not news: Many retailers report a general fear of tough competition with \nonline retailers like Amazon.\n\nSolution: It\u2019s too early to talk about the \u201cretail apocalypse.\u201d Why? Consider the following:\n\n\u2022 Only specific markets are bigger in e-commerce than in brick-and-mortar\n\u2022 There are certain product categories that customers prefer to buy in-store rather \n\nthan online\n\u2022 Overall growth of e-commerce sales has slowed \n\u2022 85% of retail sales still happen in-store\n\nThis means that it is a perfect time for both brick-and-mortar and e-commerce\nretailers to compete for innovations and\u2014as a result\u2014a bigger, more loyal, and\nbetter customer audience.\n\nhttps://www.cnbc.com/2017/08/03/retails-not-dead-and-physical-stores-still-matter-goldman-says.html\n\n\nwhitepaper | Shoptalk: Top 9 Retail Challenges and Solutions 3\n\n2. Leveraging in-store advantage\n\nChallenge: Retailers of all sizes, from a single Austin boutique to international multi-\nthousand chains of stores, have implemented omni-channels for their businesses across \nbrick-and-mortar, mobile, online, and more to stay relevant.\n\nBut many retailers are asking: What unprecedented experience could be offered to \ncustomers in-store? After all, brick-and-mortar stores still offer things that e-commerce \ncannot. Tangibility means assessing a product before buying, and in-store experience \nmeans an opportunity for social interaction while shopping.\n\nSolution: Brick-and-mortar stores still provide the best capabilities to prove quality, size, \nsmell, touch, play, experience, and \u201ctry before you buy.\u201d\n\nBrick-and-mortar has unlimited capabilities to reassure buyers that they are making the \nright decision. For example, a British children\u2019s car seat producer put a real car into their \nbrick-and-mortar store: customers can take any child safety seat, put it into the real car, \nand put their child inside to assess fit before buying.\n\nLeveraging physical access to items in the store could be the answer to enticing \ncustomers. Multiply it with digital transformation tools like automatic size \nmeasurements, item matching, personalization, and customer journey\u2014and you\u2019re \nlooking at a better in-store experience.\n\n3. Demand prediction and inventory management\n\nChallenge: Many retailers complained about unpredictable and sometimes uncontrolled \ninventory management. Some stores are overloaded with unwanted items, and some \nare suffering from lost revenue due to a lack of in-store items. Omni-channel and \na combination of different delivery options add additional challenges, along with \nthousands of SKUs.\n\nRetailers want to know how to forecast demand to match the items in their inventories, and \nto get real-time updates on when inventory is depleted for both in-store and online orders. \n\nSolution: Modern machine learning and data integration techniques allow retailers to \ntake back control over inventory. We advise:\n\n\n\nwhitepaper | Shoptalk: Top 9 Retail Challenges and Solutions 4\n\n\u2022 Demand prediction. Modern machine learning algorithms takes a variety of data \nand turns it into an advanced demand prediction model with up to 90% accuracy. \nData includes in-house data, such as history of sales (PoS data), inventory history, and \nvendor order history, as well as external data such as seasonality, weather conditions \nand forecast, social sentiments, and event schedules, which can. For a look at this \ntechnology in action, take a look at the real-time demo that SoftServe presented at \nShoptalk. The demo demonstrates a demand prediction model based on grocery store \ndata and machine learning models we\u2019ve created.\n\n\u2022 Anomaly detection. Similar machine learning algorithms can keep a constant eye on \nsales and detect anomalies in real time for effective reaction.\n\n\u2022 Vendor Auto Order. Implement a system that works together with PoS data and a \ndemand prediction machine learning. This allows for the placing of automatic orders to \nvendors, or relocating the request for the items when the system is out of stock. Such \na system accounts for the amount of time needed to relocate the item, or the time \nrequired by the vendor to send it. This system also accounts for the demand forecast \ndata to ensure that the right items arrive when needed, neither understocking or \noverstocking.\n\n\u2022 Real-time Inventory Synchronization. Inventory synchronization can be similar to \nrelational databases: if only one item is left in-store, only one person can buy it. It can\u2019t \nbe bought simultaneously in-store and online by two different customers, even if only \na few milliseconds separate these two buying requests. Inventory synchronization \nensures there is no confusion between online and brick-and-mortar stores.\n\n4. The challenges of customer data \n\nProblem: Many retail companies want to build a tailored experience for their customers, \nincluding custom recommendations and treatments. But proper service requires precise \nand accurate customer data, which is not something they will necessarily want to share.\n\nSolution: The best source of customer data is the customer himself. Consider the following:\n\n\u2022 If there are problems gathering data directly from customers, retailers should be \nprepared to provide incentives. Offering should include something that will make \npurchases less expensive, reduce friction, or lead to a better, more personalized \nexperience. Consider offering discounts for information, or paperless systems that \nkeep receipts and loyalty information in a central location.\n\n\u2022 You also don\u2019t have to ask 100% of your customers for 100% of their information. \nModern machine learning techniques such as clusterization, regression models, \nand k-means allow the extrapolation of precisely gathered data from 30% of your \ncustomers and applying it to the remaining 70% with up to 80-90% accuracy. Combine \ndirect information from your customers and finding similar customers based on their \nhistory, biorhythms, feedback, and demographic information.\n\n\u2022 Explore another demo that SoftServe demoed at Shoptalk, which demonstrates \ncutting-edge personalization based on machine learning and the OCEAN paradigm.\n\nhttp://195.160.232.94:3838/CustomerProduct_Analytics/\nhttp://195.160.232.94:3838/CustomerProduct_Analytics/\nhttp://195.160.232.94:5757/\n\n\nwhitepaper | Shoptalk: Top 9 Retail Challenges and Solutions 5\n\n5. Product search and attribution\n\nChallenge: If a customer can\u2019t find a product in-store, or if there are too many products \nto sift through in an online interface, considerable time is wasted on attribution. And if \ncustomers can\u2019t find the products\u2014they can\u2019t buy them.\n\nSolution: For e-commerce, search functions are usually executed in one of three ways: \nby drilling down through categories; by using texts or voice search; or by using product, \nsimilar items or \u201cbuy together\u201d recommendations. Text search is very dependent on the \nproduct description and attributes, but keeping and curating product descriptions and \nattributes can take ages and considerable overhead for retailers with a large amount of \nstock. Make a better search function with the following:\n\n\u2022 Automating the process of product descriptions and attribution as much as possible \nto ensure customers can always easily find your items online, and to ensure minimum \ntime to e-commerce for new items. See how a product attribution and automated \nmachine learning algorithm works for product recommendations, based purely on the \nproduct image, in another demo SoftServe created for Shoptalk.\n\n\u2022 For brick-and-mortar stores, specifically, we recommend using the attribution and \nproduct recommendations technology described above, as well as interactive mobile \napplications. These combine online search and in-store navigation capabilities, as well \nas customer experience and personalization technologies like picking size and color, \naugmented reality to check the overall look, compatibility, and more.\n\nhttp://195.160.232.94:443/\n\n\nwhitepaper | Shoptalk: Top 9 Retail Challenges and Solutions 6\n\n6. Pick the right price \n\nChallenge: Many retailers approached us with questions about technology assistance, \nasking about the maximum possible price for the maximum revenue and profitability. How \ndo you know when the price is right?\n\nSolution: There are internet-scrapers and machine learning and mathematical statistic \nalgorithms which allow retailers to gather the maximum information on existing products, \ncompetitor pricing, social sentiments, weather conditions and forecast, and many other \ndata points. All of these data points come together to make up a reliable model which will \nproduce an efficient price to support the required revenue and profitability.\n\n7. Mobile experience is far from perfect\n\nChallenge: Though there has been serious progress in mobile applications for retail, it \nhas room to improve.  Research demonstrates a tendency for customers to use mobile \napplications to search for the products they need, but to then switch to web pages in \norder to commence the buying transaction. Many customers complain mobile applications \ninefficiently address buying on the go (for example, the need to keep a mobile device in \none hand and a credit card in the other hand to complete a transaction).\n\nAnother bad habit is the tendency to take e-commerce usage patterns built for mobile \ndevices, and to try to duplicate them for the in-store experience. But customers are not \ncoming to a brick-and-mortar store for a linear \u201csearch-basket-checkout\u201d experience. \n\nSolution: Do not blindly replicate what you already have in e-commerce solution \ninto the mobile app. Mobile apps often require a different usage flow, and therefore \na separate track of user experience workshops, user testing, and research for the \nexceptional mobile experience.\n\nFor mobile brick-and-mortar applications, features should be specifically designed to ease the \ncustomer journey in-store, not singularly shopping on a screen. In-store applications should \nfeatures accents such as in-store navigation, or augmented reality functions to test the items \nin full action or in different colors, to experiment with product matchers, and more.\n\n8. Glean actionable insights from on-hand data \n\nChallenge: The amount of data being gathered and analyzed is growing exponentially. \nThis has a direct impact on the ability of employees to glean actionable insights from data \nsuch as anomalies, trends, correlations, and more. It is greatly reducing root cause analysis \ncapabilities and leaves many issues undiscovered.\n\nThe reason for this is that most companies concentrate on employee-controlled reports \nand dashboards to find reasonable business intelligence (BI) insights. But people are \nlimited in their capability to analyze more than several combined parameters, or to \u201cslice \nand dice\u201d data against all possible filters.\n\n\n\nwhitepaper | Shoptalk: Top 9 Retail Challenges and Solutions 7\n\nSolution: Augmented analytics are a great alternative to traditional BI. Imagine an \nalgorithm based on machine learning models that validates anomalies and correlations \nacross all possible filters. Such an algorithm can slice and dice the data and then suggest \ndata views which highlight areas that require validation from an analyst.\n\nAugmented analytics dramatically reduces the amount of undiscovered problematic areas \nand the time required to find them. This allows the business to concentrate on resolution \nand value rather than searching.\n\nExample: Imagine researching whether there\u2019s a correlation between a product category \nand store parameters (size, location, years in business, etc). If there are several hundred \nproduct categories, and dozens of store parameters, manually checking correlations and \nactionable insights would take a significant amount of time.

Successful innovation projects \n\nChallenge: Retailers want to know where to start and how to make sure they succeed with \nretail innovations project. But there are so many directions in which to go when it comes to \ninnovation\u2014how should retailers decide the best path? \n\nSolution: Look at some of the key points SoftServe uses during project implementation \nfor retail companies:\n\n\u201cWhy\u201d before \u201chow\u201d\n\nMany participants admitted that their companies jump on data project implementation \nbefore they understand the details of what they are trying to achieve. This leads them to \ndiscover their goals in the middle of implementation, costing extra time and money.\n\nEstablish the \u201cwhy\u201d before the \u201chow.\u201d A Design Thinking Workshop (also known as an \nExperience Design Workshop) is a way of approaching the data problem by placing \npersonas and their needs, restrictions, and advantages at the center of the discussion.\nIt allows for focus on specific company differentiators and target audience rather\nthan copying competitors.\n\nDesign Thinking Workshops ideally involve all parties related to the problem being \nresolved. This allows different parts of your business to communicate more efficiently \nand to understand each other\u2019s needs and pain points in an open, respectful, and trusted \ndiscussion. A Design Thinking Workshop results in the answers to who, what, where, when, \nwhy, and how. It is also able to justify the usage of specific approaches, techniques, and \ntechnologies, and when to gather more information before diving in and wasting revenue.\n\nRun an MVP or PoC \n\nA well-planned project breaks against a wall of technical or business limitations which were \nnot obvious during the planning phase, but which became obvious during implementation. \nBut a simple and inexpensive PoC (proof of concept) or MVP (minimum viable product) \nproject can save you money and effort by increasing the quality of requirements and \ndecreasing the risk of choosing a wrong approach or technology.\n\n\n\nwhitepaper | Shoptalk: Top 9 Retail Challenges and Solutions 9\n\nValidate through continuous results\n\nAny great idea can be ruined during the production usage. Ensure that every iteration \nis made in the right direction: Validate your ideas in the early stages, even before your \nproject starts, by researching the need, making surveys, and more. Use A/B testing \neverywhere you can after implementing every functionality. And A/B testing doesn\u2019t have \nto start from real customers: Use employees, colleagues, friends, or even paid research\u2014\nanything that gives you a good validation of your ideas and approach.\n\nBring early value\n\nEnterprise-level projects often require six, nine, or 12 months and longer to be \nimplemented. Traditionally, projects had to be completed before using the resultant \nsystems and getting tangible results. Not only does this cause a gap between ideation \nand results, but it is also becoming harder to get sign-off for starting implementation \nprojects in uncertain conditions. \n\nRegardless of the size and the nature of the project, bring value as soon as you can. Once \nyou establish value, convince your business of the efficiency of this approach and expand. \nEven small functionality can lead to increased business efficiency, overall data project \nsuccess, and early adoption. Use cloud solutions and infrastructure as code, framework, \nand accelerators to concentrate on building value rather than infrastructure and baseline. \nUse an agile approach, where value is being delivered every sprint (usually every week or \ntwo) to get early value, early approach adjustment, close feedback from end users, and \ndecreased time and cost required to make adjustments.\n\nConclusion: \nThe battle for retail is not lost. \n\nDespite popular opinion to the contrary, traditional brick-and-mortar stores still account \nfor a majority of transactions across the globe. However, in order to stay competitive, it\u2019s \nimportant to stay in touch with the needs and expectations of customers. Implementing \nsensible solutions is the first step to perfecting the omni-channel experience, reaching \ncustomers directly, and delivering what it is that they are looking for.\n\nBridge the gap between digital and traditional.

But how can retailers benefit from them in practice?\n\nWhile Amazon looms in the background for most retailers, the possibilities for making unique AI and ML \nsolutions are endless. Personalize the customer experience by learning what they want\u2014and providing \nit\u2014from discovering customer personas via psychometrics, to visual product recommendations, to \nimmersive experiences, and more.\n\nIn this white paper, discover how to implement AI and ML successfully to save time, energy, and money.\n\nWhy AI and ML?\n\nThe retail industry is one of the most data-driven industries, and retailers have run analytics projects \nfor decades. So, what has changed with new technologies like AI and ML?\n\nIt\u2019s a good question. While traditional analytics provide a strong methodology, AI and ML are more \npowerful and can give better insights on larger amounts and varieties of data.\n\nBut there are also human and process aspects to consider. Previously, retail subject matter experts \n(SMEs) and business stakeholders gave a task to their analytics team to obtain specific analysis or \nstatistics. Today, data science engineers are able to explore all combinations of data, using hundreds of \nAI/ML algorithms to extract correlations and anomalies from the data independently and then explain \nfindings to stakeholders.\n\nIn other words, traditional analytics used to support what was already known. AI and ML, by contrast, \nare tailored to provide yet unknown insights, opening new horizons for improving the business.\n\nhttp://195.160.232.94:5757/\nhttp://195.160.232.94:443/\n\n\nwhitepaper | AI + ML in Retail: Best Practices 3\n\nFinding the focus of AI/ML projects in retail\n\nWith considerable customer demand for click-and-collect solutions and personalization, AI and ML \nalgorithms allow for competition with retail giants like Amazon, enabling the same (or better) speed, \nimpact, and efficiency in:\n\n\u2022 Delivery\n\u2022 Fulfillment\n\u2022 Assortment planning\n\u2022 Price optimization\n\u2022 Personalization \n\nAnd it all starts with data.\n\nA great algorithm is impossible without a sufficient variety \nand volume of quality data.\n\nQuality is crucial. Improving poorly structured, inaccurate, or contradictory data will take time, leaving \nlittle room for developing the algorithm itself. And sufficient volume is required for the maximum \nefficiency of AI/ML algorithms. For example, a history of any 10 transactions results in limited accuracy, \nwhile algorithms with millions of transactions show maximum efficiency.\n\nVariety is also important. Business leaders should make sure that the algorithm covers all influence \nfactors; not just the obvious transactional and regional data, but something that goes above and \nbeyond. Consider the most unusual data sources available from customers for a complete picture of \ncustomer needs. Even when considering \u201cobvious\u201d data sources, think outside the box and look at \ntraditional data from another angle.\n\nAI and ML are not replacements\n\nA common misconception is that AI and ML solutions can and should replace any, if not all, existing \napplications and infrastructure. That\u2019s not the case.\n\nAI and ML algorithms operate on the data delivered from informational systems. In many cases, the \ninsights and results from AI and ML algorithms are then used within existing informational systems.\n\nAI and ML make the existing infrastructure and application \nlandscape smarter.\nConsider e-commerce websites and ML product recommendation engines. Algorithms capture an \nimage of a product, generate attributes for recommendations based on the image, and then suggesting \nsimilar or related items from inventory. Such an algorithm doesn\u2019t replace the e-commerce website, but \n\n\n\nwhitepaper | AI + ML in Retail: Best Practices 4\n\nintegrates into the website using APIs, greatly empowering the user experience. \n\nAnd while AI and ML algorithms can provide unbelievable insights, it\u2019s important to remember to give \nthem time: they might be limited in scalability until insights are automatically picked up and used. Make \nit an ultimate goal for your AI and ML projects to automatically push promotion campaigns, change \nprice, and submit order requests to vendors\u2014eventually. At least, once you are comfortable with the \naccuracy of the insights. Doing so helps scale the business to cut back on human error, increase speed, \nand boost revenue streams.\n\nBringing in the pros\n\nWhen building AI and ML solutions, data scientists and ML engineers provide crucial value. \n\nIt\u2019s no secret that data science and ML engineering are professions in high demand and low supply. \nGoogle, Facebook, Amazon\u2014all hunt these professionals far in advance. And the competition for talent \nis only beginning.\n\nOur best advice is to start building relations with data science communities, universities, and even \nschools to build a connection with your brand and grow relationships with engineers. Find a data \nscience community or meet-up group within your region and network in advance.\n\nOnce you have the experts on your side, know where and when to implement their expertise for the \nbest value.\n\nIt isn\u2019t unusual to hire data science/machine learning experts before the data layer and infrastructure \nare ready. However, this causes top experts to sit underutilized, waiting for the data infrastructure to be \nbuilt, and for data to be cleansed and ready for analysis.\n\nData engineers should be involved in building the data infrastructure and managing quality assurance \nbefore hiring talented data science engineers.\n\nThis saves time and money and keeps pensioned data science engineers engaged\u2014not standing by, \nwaiting for action. \n\n\n\nwhitepaper | AI + ML in Retail: Best Practices 5\n\nData science engineers also need as much freedom as possible. The best-case scenario for data science \nengineers is finding insights within the business and then sitting down and explaining them. \n\nFor the best results, engineers should have access to the \ndata and computation power they need, and enough time \nto think and experiment.\n\nLet talented engineers do what they do best: dream, plan, and execute. Doing so can result in \namazing results.\n\nThe waiting game\n\nEven with all of these components in place, it must still be acknowledged that ML and AI projects are \ntime-consuming due to a significant R&D component and should be projected accordingly. Normally, \nseveral iterations are required before considerable value is realized.\n\nManage stakeholder expectations from the very beginning, commit long-term in general, and be as agile \nas possible to adjust course direction when required.\n\nAt SoftServe we say, \u201cThink big, start small, start now.\u201d There\u2019s no need for overreaching initial budgets \nany more than there is for prolonged delay. Identify value points early and deliver them consistently, \nstarting with \u201cquick win\u201d tasks that build momentum and trust\u2014and do it now rather than later.\n\nAlso, perpetually track and improve results. Even if your algorithm is far from ideal, demonstrating \nreasonable evidence of the algorithm\u2019s progress is a good way to keep stakeholders motivated to keep \ninvesting into the project.\n\nConclusion\n\nIt\u2019s impossible to talk about innovation in retail without talking about Amazon. There is much to be \ngleaned and replicated for those brands willing to emulate without attempting to be Amazon.\n\nAI and ML solutions deliver information about customers, automate processes, and grow revenue\u2014but \nit\u2019s all in the execution. Knowing how and where to start, hiring the right professionals, and managing \nexpectations are the best way to get a foothold in the market.\n\nIs your retail business reaching its full potential with AI and ML?

For some,\nit\u2019s the latest way to create positive, memorable, and valuable interactions with customers.\n\nGamification disrupts traditional methods of customer engagement to make interactions\npositive, entertaining, and profitable. How? By providing motivation and driving desired\nbehavior through incentivizing customer activities and transactions.\n\nMany industries have incorporated gamification into customer engagement over the\nyears, from loyalty programs to quizzes, interactive video games, and augmented and\nvirtual reality experiences.\n\nFinancial applications turn savings into games where the \u201cplayer\u201d can convert game \nrewards into cash savings. Retailers use marketing quizzes and point systems to \nreward customers with prizes and gain important personalization insights. Media uses \ngamification as a way to make content interactive and engaging.\n\nHowever, one of the industries that stands to benefit the most is noticeably absent:\nhealthcare.\n\nThe opportunity to gamify healthcare is virtually limitless. Give patients incentives to \nadhere to treatment plans. Reward the chronically ill for healthy lifestyle choices, tracking\nimprovements. Drive advances in epidemiology and overall population health and \nwellness.\n\nGamification\u2014if healthcare companies embrace it\u2014stands to literally change the game.\n\nGood job, \nyou took \nyour pill \non time\n\n+ points5\n\nhttps://www.forbes.com/sites/tomaslaurinavicius/2017/12/05/startup-of-the-week-long-game/#521047614f72\nhttps://www.forbes.com/sites/tomaslaurinavicius/2017/12/05/startup-of-the-week-long-game/#521047614f72\nhttps://www.business2community.com/ecommerce/gamification-make-mobile-retail-web-apps-even-engaging-effective-01972022\nhttps://www.td.org/insights/does-gamification-actually-work-yes-and-heres-why\n\n\nwhitepaper | Get in the Game: Gamification in Healthcare 3\n\nGamification is wildly successful within the segment of health and fitness. It makes\nsense: most sports are fundamentally games themselves and provide competitive\nmotivation for health and fitness.\n\nTracking activities through IoT devices becomes an easy way to reward behavior, and a \nvariety of different businesses have been providing these apps for years. Smart watches \nequipped with Apple\u2019s suite of fitness apps, and the now infamous concept of \u201cclosing your \nrings,\u201d FitBit\u2019s 10,000 steps, MyFitnessPal\u2019s diet and activity tracker, and more provide a \nmeans for users to track movements as well as incentive to do more. \n\nLet\u2019s get motivated\n\nRegardless of efforts made by payers, providers, insurance agencies, and others, the \npatient ultimately has full autonomy over his care plan and how well he follows that course \nof care\u2014if he chooses to follow it at all. Care plans are always reliant on the patient: \nrefilling prescriptions, attending doctor appointments, getting regular exercise, conforming \nto diet restrictions, and more.\n\nWhen a patient takes his medicine, he reduces his risk of recurrence and increases his \nchance of recovery. When he follows his outpatient treatment guide or performs physical \ntherapy exercises on his own at home, he is more likely to recover fully. All of these \nactivities benefit the patient while realizing lower costs for providers.\n\nSo how can healthcare companies motivate patients to be active participants in their \ncare plans? \n\nMotivation is a core tenet of gamification. After all, it was designed to encourage the\nright behaviors from the user or consumer. In healthcare, gamification should be used to \nmotivate patients to invest in their own care, producing results for both themselves and \ntheir providers. Gamification therefore serves as the incentive: delivering motivation in a \nway that is seamless with the patient\u2019s daily life, easy to adopt\u2014and, dare we say, fun.\n\nWhile there are many tools currently available to monitor and encourage health, fitness, \nchronic disease, rehabilitation, and more, games power these tools with the promise of\na reward. That reward can take many forms: entertainment, monetary incentive, or pure \ncompetition. And in doing so, it increases the likelihood of improving individual health \noutcomes, gaining a better analysis of individual patients, augmenting personalization \nefforts, and lowering costs for healthcare businesses.\n\nWhat does gamification look like in action?\n\nOn your mark, get set, go!\n\nHealthcare leaders need to integrate better technologies to drive patient adherence and \nlower costs. Gamification is an intuitive way to drive both simultaneously, and the success \nof this approach is already on the books.\n\n\n\nwhitepaper | Get in the Game: Gamification in Healthcare 4\n\nSetting goals and tracking improvement is a key factor in the success of all of these \nprograms and their users' outcomes.\n\nTracking data doesn\u2019t need to be limited to movement either\u2014for example, weight on \na scale or a heartrate that is lowered over time are easily measured metrics to gauge \nprogress. It is when these metrics are paired with the right incentive (emotional, monetary \nreward, etc.) that we see motivation, and ultimately behavior change.\n\nGamified tracking can also be applied to chronic illnesses like diabetes. SoftServe \npartnered with Outcomes Based Healthcare to develop Sense360, an application that \nhelped patients with diabetes by monitoring phone use to detect changes in the condition. \n\nBut while it\u2019s easy to incentivize some with competition and beating personal goals, many\nneed more motivation. Motivation can be a roadblock on the way to better health for\nthose who don\u2019t exercise, are less motivated, or chronically ill, and even in rehabilitation.\n\nFor those companies unsure where to start gamification efforts, a first foray can be a\nmodification of an existing loyalty program. In this \u201cgame,\u201d patients are rewarded with\ndiscounts for following medication regimens, fulfilling certain activities, attending certain\ngyms, ordering healthy meals, and more. This format requires several components:\npartnership on the part of the healthcare business, regulatory compliance from the partner \nand the patient, and a reliable way of tracking activities, such as via IoT devices and GPS.\n\nThe game in this scenario can be a few different things: awarding those who track rewards\nthe most often, unlocking better monetary offers that map to more difficult activities, or\ncreating beacons at different partner locations to register check-ins during a scavenger\nhunt, for example.\n\nhttps://www.softserveinc.com/en-us/news/softserve-helps-obh-use-big-data-and-analytics/\n\n\nwhitepaper | Get in the Game: Gamification in Healthcare 5\n\nHealth insurer AIA Australia offers members the app AIA Vitality to cash in on a variety\nof rewards for healthy lifestyle choices.

With the latest iteration of the Vitality app, AIA \nAustralia experienced a 40% increase in core engagement over the past two years.\n\nLeveling up in Healthcare\n\nFor those who already employ gamificiation, or those who want to operate at the cutting \nedge, consider the next level: immersive experiences.\n\nImmersive experiences are creating a lot of excitement in the healthcare industry. \nAugmented and virtual reality (AR and VR) components integrate fitness games into \nreal life. By eliminating game controllers and screens, everyday movements seamlessly \ntransform into an immersive game that keeps patients active.\n\nTake the popular AR game of 2017, Pok\u00e9mon Go. Players use smartphones to explore \ntheir surroundings in order to collect different Pok\u00e9mon and accomplish different \nchallenges. One study found that the game increased the number of those who walked \nmore than 10,000 steps each day from 15% to 28%. Another study showed that playing \nraised moderate to vigorous physical activity by about 50 minutes per week and reduced \nsedentary behavior by 30 minutes a day. Imagine integrating this concept into a healthcare \napp to lower costs and boost patient activity.\n\nOutside the realm of fitness, AR and VR are already being applied to patients going through \nrehabilitation and recovery, using motivating scenarios to stretch abilities. Patients within \nthis segment include those with disabilities, those relearning motor functions, recovering \nfrom surgery, or simply undertaking preventative maintenance. Patients immerse \nthemselves in different realities that make exercises engaging and different, allowing them \nto keep their minds on accomplishing the task at hand. \n\nAR and VR increase activity for these patients, creating scenarios that compel them to \ncomplete their courses of care.\n\nIn a recent study, stroke patients who underwent virtual reality rehab had improved arm \nand hand movements compared to conventional rehab after four weeks of therapy. In the \nmonths following the study, doctors found that virtual reality patients continued to have \nbetter mobility than the non-virtual reality patients. \n\nPush the play button\n\nThe benefits of gamification in healthcare are myriad\u2014so why aren\u2019t more healthcare \ncompanies gamifying?\n\nhttp://Health insurer AIA Australia offers members the app AIA Vitality to cash in on a variety\rof rewards for healthy lifestyle choices.

Execution is key\u2014patients won\u2019t respond to games that are poorly\ndelivered or deployed, that don\u2019t effectively engage, or that rely on legacy technology.\n\nSuccessful gamification is all about experience design. Get into the mind of the patient and\nunlock motivation factors that will drive behaviors and provide a user experience to deliver\nthem, accomplishing business goals.\n\nThe game is the vehicle for solving patient needs. When considering gamification in\nhealthcare, we recommend the following questions:\n\n\u2022 What problem will this solve? \u2013 Regimen compliance, fitness goals, maintaining\nwellness, meeting rehabilitation goals, adjusting to a lifestyle change\n\n\u2022 Who are my patients? \u2013 Are they looking for health and fitness, monitoring chronic\nillness, improving rehabilitation experiences\n\n\u2022 What behavior is being driven? \u2013 Exercise, activity, diet, monitoring body data,\nappointment attendance\n\n\u2022 What is the motivation? \u2013 Monetary, discount, competition, journey\n\nFrom there, there are innumerable possibilities for building the perfect game, engaging \npatients, and providing better outcomes.\n\nGames drive positive outcomes\n\nGamification holds particular promise for the world of healthcare. From capitalizing \non health and fitness applications that are already in place, to leveraging AR and VR \ntechnology for immersive experiences, games have the power to drive positive outcomes.\n\nGamification disrupts traditional methods of customer engagement to make interactions \npositive, entertaining, and profitable.

Valuable financial records are a prime target for those with bad intentions, and \nbreaches not only affect individual customers but cause significant brand damage.\n\nAs the financial services industry evolves to include better\u2014and more innovative\u2014\ntechnology, measures must be taken to keep data sealed tight, and within regulatory \ncompliance.  \n\nGive consumers what they want\u2014but take care\n\nToday\u2019s financial customers demand convenient, fast, and personalized digital experiences. \nThe ability to have on-demand access to all financial parameters at the tap of an app is no \nlonger a nice to have, it is essential. \n\nBut for an industry notorious for legacy systems, meeting those needs can be a challenge. \nFortunately, there are many paths for financial services businesses to update systems and \nreach customers\u2014securely. To that end, two clear paths have emerged: cloud migration \nand distributed ledger technology (DLT). \n\nMigrating to the cloud augments storage space while reducing power consumption and \ncosts, allowing companies to scale up and deliver more quickly. For financial services \nspecifically, this means a faster turnaround for service areas such as credit scoring, \nstatements, consumer payments, and billing.  \n\nDLT has also taken the industry by storm, offering a faster, more transparent way of doing \nbusiness. By its own structure\u2014which stacks data block-by-block\u2014security is intrinsic \nwithin the structure of the code, making transactions and contracts secure by nature.\n\nUnfortunately, there is an inherent misperception of security in both technologies: that \nfull security is \u201cbuilt in.\u201d This could not be further from the truth. For companies looking \nto leverage either technology, or any new technology for that matter, in-depth scrutiny is \nrequired before implementation. Let\u2019s dive deeper into common misconceptions\u2014and \nwhat to do about them\u2014in cloud migration and DLT. \n\nCloud migration\n\nWithin cloud migration, scalability and performance often take the spotlight over security. \nAnd assumptions about the nature of cloud security itself can lead to vulnerabilities.\n\nFor many financial businesses, one of the attractive features of the cloud (beyond the \npossibilities for saving costs and increasing agility) is the level of built-in security. But this is \noften a misreading of the cloud\u2019s shared responsibility model. \n\nCloud security and liability on the part of the cloud provider is limited. To clear any doubt, \nlet us be clear: turnkey security does not mean a risk-free cloud. In fact, there is a \nshared responsibility between both the cloud customer and the cloud provider.\n\n\n\nwhitepaper | It\u2019s Time to (Securely) Innovate Financial Services 3\n\nThe shared responsibility model means that while the cloud provider is responsible for \nthe security of the cloud, the customer is responsible for security in the cloud. Essentially \nthe cloud provider is responsible for the security of the cloud infrastructure, and for \nthe security of foundational services such as compute, storage, database, and network. \nThe cloud customer, meanwhile, has a long list of his own security responsibilities, such \nas client and server encryption, network traffic protection; OS, network, and firewall \nconfiguration; platform, application, identity, and access management; and\u2014of course\u2014\ncustomer data.\n\nAll solutions, data, and applications that exist within the cloud need their own, customized \nsecurity on the part of the cloud customer (i.e. the business).\n\nAnother problem is using legacy security solutions that simply don\u2019t belong anywhere in \nthe cloud. It isn\u2019t unusual for a cloud migration to be a direct shift of existing legacy systems \nfrom one location to another. But while the increased agility of the cloud increases market \nshare and volume, using outdated security systems to guard them is often inadequate. \nSecurity should therefore be updated to match the technology or platform upon which the \nsolution is placed.\n\nAs for those who are doubting the importance of security (if there are any doubters \nleft in our readership): corporate managers need not look deep into press archives to \nidentify recent security breaches\u2014action must be taken to regularly assess the health \nand security of your system to ensure that vulnerabilities are mitigated. Security \nis something that needs to be monitored around the clock, as well as regular security \nassessments and health checks that test vulnerabilities within the system and improve or \nupgrade it as needed.\n\nCustomer\nResponsibility\n\nCustomer Data\n\nCloud Foundation Services\n\nCloud Global Infrastructure\n\nClient Side Data Encryption& \nData Integrity Authentication\n\nNetwork Traffic Protection \n(Encryption/Integrity/Indentity)\n\nPlatform, Applications, Identity & Access Management\n\nOperating System, Network & Firewall Configuration\n\nSecurity  \n'in' the Cloud\n\nSecurity  \n'of' the Cloud\n\nCloud Provider\nResponsibility\n\nServer Side Encryption (File \nSystem and/or Data)\n\nCompute Storage Database Network\n\nRegions Availability Zones Edge Locations\n\n\n\nwhitepaper | It\u2019s Time to (Securely) Innovate Financial Services 4\n\nLet\u2019s get distributed\n\nDLT enables direct transactions, increases speed and transparency, and reduces fraud. But \nfor financial leaders, introducing DLT into the ecosystem means new and potentially more \ncomplex security risks.\n\nWhile most consider DLT to be airtight, the security of its application is entirely reliant on \nthose within the network. Increased transparency means transparency for all kinds of \ndifferent players, and not all with the best intentions. On the edge, there is significant room \nfor fraud to damage an otherwise secure solution.\n\nIn early 2018, Japanese cryptocurrency exchange Coincheck lost $530 million in a \ncryptocurrency theft. The source of the attack? Hackers gained access to the internet-\nconnected repository where users store cryptocurrencies (the \u201chot wallet\u201d). While the \ntechnology stayed intact, access to it was compromised. \n\nIn order to maintain the most secure posture, all members within a DLT network must be \nconstantly aware of the vulnerabilities that exist in its application, and how to avoid them.\n\nPutting your money where your mouth is\n\nThe financial services industry\u2019s aging, legacy software and IT solutions are difficult to \ndefend against modern cyberattacks. Running security as an add-on is risky\u2014tools that \ndon\u2019t integrate seamlessly need greater scrutiny than a system that has comprehensive, \ncustom security built into its foundation. Often, legacy systems don\u2019t scale to include \nprotection against modern security risks.\n\n\n\nwhitepaper | It\u2019s Time to (Securely) Innovate Financial Services 5\n\nThe best way to keep data secure is by weaving security into a solution from the beginning. \nIntegrating security with all other components of the solution architecture ensures \nseamlessness, making upgrades simpler and augmenting protection. \n\nBut at what point is built-in security in need of patches or upgrades? And how much \nadditional security is needed for a solution that incorporates legacy systems?\n\nThere are several things to keep in mind when building new solutions for financial services. \nLet\u2019s walk through the top considerations:\n\nRisk Assessment \nThe first step in assessing security compliance and posture is to assess risk. What are the \nmajor security risks and how can they best be addressed in order of priority?\n\nFinancial institutions should take inventory of all components within the system and assign \nvalue and risk. Customer data, back-end infrastructure, new solutions\u2014how is each valued \nwithin the larger structure, and what is its vulnerability? By assigning value and assessing \nrisk, financial leaders can then create a more substantial architecture.\n\nAssessing Architecture \nOnce the value and the risk are clear, the next secure step is to build an architecture to \nprotect data. Applying knowledge gained from the risk assessment, a firm architecture is \nthen assessed and tested, made scalable, and implemented. \n\nArchitecture assessments should extend throughout the infrastructure, as well\u2014from \nsolutions to applications. It\u2019s not uncommon to overlook security measures by accident, but \narchitecture must be a consideration for everything from back-end solutions to customer-\nfacing apps. Failing to consider comprehensive security will leave solutions vulnerable to \nattack.\n\nMonitoring \nWhat is the maintenance plan? After assessing risk and building a comprehensive \narchitecture, the most important step in keeping data secure is ongoing monitoring. \n\nWith the evolution of attacks happening every day, security teams must constantly check for \nvulnerabilities within any infrastructure, solution, or application. \n\n\n\nwhitepaper | It\u2019s Time to (Securely) Innovate Financial Services 6\n\nConclusion\n\nSecurity today is a constant, tireless reality for virtually any company. Financial businesses \nthat defer investments in infrastructure and technology solutions to protect customer and \nproprietary data risk losing customers and becoming tomorrow\u2019s news headline.\n\nAs financial businesses implement more innovative solutions into legacy systems\u2014and \nexperiment with hot technology\u2014the higher the risk is that data will be compromised. \nWhether cloud migration, DLT, or any number of recent innovations that are revolutionizing \nfinancial services, concrete steps proper steps should be taken to ensure security is airtight.\n\nAssess risk, build a strong architecture, and continuously monitor your systems to \nremain secure. \n\nAre you ready to take your infrastructure and technology solutions to the next level?  \nContact SoftServe to get started today.\n\n\n\nABOUT US\nSoftServe is a digital authority that advises and provides at the cutting-\nedge of technology.

Imagine glancing at a restaurant provided you \nwith information about the facilities, menus, prices, and reviews. Imagine a world where \neducation exists in a completely controlled and measured virtual environment, with the \nhighest engagement levels and personalization. Imagine a manufacturing plant where \nemployees can access necessary information on the spot, getting on-the-spot support, \nhands-free, and without breaking the usual workflow. \n\nImagine the world of extended reality.\n\nExtended reality (XR) combines a number of tech directions that change the ways of \ninteracting with the physical world through digital information. Common segments are:\n\nAccording to a recent market forecast by Artillry Intelligence, global XR product revenues \nare projected to grow from $4.2 billion USD in 2017 to $61.2 billion USD in 2022. That\u2019s a \n71% compound annual growth rate. \n\nHow can your business get in on the action? Let\u2019s take a look at common examples today.\n\n4 TYPES OF USER EXPERIENCE\nSince the release of Google Cardboard in 2014 and the mass adoption of AR/VR that \nfollowed, a number of ways to experience extended reality have emerged:\n\n360-degree Video\n\nThe simplest use case of VR is the ability to view 360-degree photos and videos. Interaction \nin such experiences is usually very limited, as all content is predefined. It is highly \naccessible and can usually be viewed on mobile-based VR with accessories like Google \nCardboard and Samsung Gear VR. The latest sales figures state 15 million devices sold. \n\nThough filming a 360-degree video requires special equipment (making production the \nmost expensive aspect of this experience), its accessibility provides a notable ROI. Despite \nthe fact that it is based on mobile phone viewing, 360-degree video provides exceptional \nvisual quality. The most popular content is nature and wild animal experiences.\n\nhttps://artillry.co/2018/06/26/enterprise-ar-revenues-to-reach-29-6-billion-by-2022/\n\n\nwhitepaper | The Next Frontier: Extended Reality in Business 3\n\nMobile AR\n\nMobile AR is another highly accessible experience, with apps that allow the user to view \ndigital content overlays in a camera view using computer vision techniques. The success of \nPok\u00e9mon Go, popular Snapchat and Instagram filters, as well as recent tech developments \nfrom Apple (ARKit), Google (ARCore), and Facebook (CameraEffects), are driving the wider \nadoption of the mobile AR experience.\n\nThe simplest experiences are based on real-world markers (QR codes, special pictures) \nthat provide anchors for digital content. Emerging advanced capabilities from products \nlike ARKit and ARCore do not require markers to recognize and track horizontal or vertical \nsurfaces. This drives these experiences towards mixed reality.\n\nInteractive VR\n\nIn contrast to 360-degree content, interactive VR experiences render content in real \ntime. This opens doors to all kinds of interactions, from gaze and head movements to \nsophisticated 6DoF (\u201csix degrees of freedom\u201d) controllers. Required hardware ranges \nfrom standalone 3DoF/6DoF headsets to more complex PC-based systems equipped with \n6DoF controllers, haptic gloves, trackers, and other accessories that provide enhanced \ninteraction with digital content. For home users, PC-based systems usually require a \npowerful graphic card to eliminate latency, rendering at a minimum of 90 fps. \n\nAR/MR Glasses\n\nGoogle is planning to relaunch Glass for the enterprise market and there are currently \ndozens of different devices for numerous applications. Most notable are Vuzix and ODG \ndevices, that are affordable and have a decent field of vision, as well as other capabilities \nwell suited for enterprise tasks such as: guided instructions and manuals, barcode \nscanning, GPS navigation, camera recordings, and more.\n\nMore complex devices, like Microsoft HoloLens and Magic Leap, support the analysis \nof surroundings (walls, surfaces, etc.) and allow digital content to interact with physical \nobjects. Currently, this is the closest experience to true extended reality, though continued \ntechnological advancement will make it available to the consumer market.\n\nXR IN ACTION: BUSINESS USE CASES\nExtended reality might require more time for universal adoption, but there are real \npossibilities for enterprise applications today.\n\nTraining and Simulation\n\nThe immersive quality and flexibility of VR opens the door to next-level training and \neducation. ABI research forecasts the growth of this segment alone to be $6.3 billion by \n\nhttps://www.vuzix.com/\nhttps://www.osterhoutgroup.com/\nhttps://www.microsoft.com/en-us/hololens\nhttps://www.magicleap.com/magic-leap-one\nhttps://www.abiresearch.com/press/enterprise-virtual-reality-training-services-gener/\n\n\nwhitepaper | The Next Frontier: Extended Reality in Business 4\n\n2022. There is huge potential for training in sports and several companies are exploring its \nbenefits for the NFL and NBA. Retail is discovering its benefits as well: Walmart created a \nVR training solution for employees to handle Black Friday and is planning to roll it out in its \ntraining centers. \n\nIn healthcare, surgery training from Osso VR, as well as various rehabilitation experiences \nis providing a safe environment for surgeons to practice. In logistics, UPS conducts VR \ntraining for drivers prior to official dispatch. It can also be widely used in HR for soft skill \ntraining, helping employees to overcome fear of public speaking (and other phobias) or to \nenhance presentation and training effectiveness. Depending on the need, training can also \nsupport a real-time multi-user environment, even via remote online connection.\n\nAnother way of training is an on-site MR headset that overlays all information for the user, \nguiding interactions with specific equipment. Adding real-time remote supervision from \na learned professional provides increased process effectiveness. Businesses can even \nleverage veteran workers by recording their operations and later using them as training \nmaterials for newcomers.\n\nIn summary, there are many benefits to training via XR.\n\n\u2022 Cost-effective. Conducting training in VR doesn\u2019t require standard equipment and \nspecialized facilities. Also, it\u2019s much easier to maintain and update. \n\n\u2022 Risk-free environment. Mistakes are unavoidable during a training process, and in \ndangerous situations the risk could be very high. Immersive experiences in VR provide \nclose-to-life situations, without any risk to trainee health.\n\n\u2022 Emergency situations. It is important to provide training for employees in situations \nthat are impossible to fully recreate in real life. For example, it is vital to make the \nright decisions quickly in emergency situations, such as natural disasters, fire training, \nemergency surgery, etc.\n\n\u2022 Advanced behavior measurement. Since training is performed in a controlled virtual \nenvironment with connected controllers and trackers, the facilitator receives metrics \nthat provide valuable insights on the process. In sports especially, coaches are able to \nprecisely monitor players\u2019 field of vision, heart rates, and reaction speeds, relying on \ndata rather than subjective decisions. \n\n\u2022 Scalability and remote performance. In the case of training for a large workforce it is \nmuch easier to conduct training remotely in VR, rather than several days of expensive \non-site training and associated travel expenses. Such an approach will guarantee \nconsistent training across the company, as well as the ability to conduct A/B testing of \nvarious approaches for optimal results.\n\nhttps://www.abiresearch.com/press/enterprise-virtual-reality-training-services-gener/\nhttps://www.theverge.com/2017/6/1/15725732/walmart-strivr-vr-training-module\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ep3rEcFHKEk\nhttp://money.cnn.com/2017/08/15/technology/business/ups-virtual-reality/index.html\nhttp://money.cnn.com/2017/08/15/technology/business/ups-virtual-reality/index.html\n\n\nwhitepaper | The Next Frontier: Extended Reality in Business 5\n\nProduct showcase and marketing\n\nAn XR experience to showcase products before purchase, or \u201ctry before you buy,\u201d \nprovides closer brand interaction in an immersive environment. It also demonstrates the \ncompany\u2019s intent to move towards innovation, attracting more customers and helping with \nrecruitment efforts.\n\nIn the real estate industry\u2014especially in the luxury segment\u2014property tours can be \ngiven remotely with more realistic experiences than ever. And VR is already being used \neffectively in retail: \n\n\u2022 Zara allows customers to explore new fashion looks in mobile AR\n\n\u2022 ModiFace helps customers try different makeup products\n\n\u2022 Ikea, Wayfair, Amazon and others allow digital furniture placement within customers\u2019 \nhomes\n\n\u2022 \u201cMagic mirrors\u201d allow shoppers to try on dozens of looks and styles in minutes\n\nExtended reality not only supports products, but the way in which they are marketed as \nwell.\n\nPok\u00e9mon Go spurred the increased use of AR for marketing promotions. Audi allows users \nto see their cars in action on the road. Lego added additional content to make stories \naround its toys \u201ccome alive.\u201d Both Universal and Disney promoted recent movies through \nSnapchat Lens and interactive magazine covers.\n\nHands-free data access\n\nWith the growing complexity of industrial equipment, XR guides and instructions \nwill become important tools for successful operation. In this case, AR glasses can \nprovide hands-free, on-location access to any information, both stored and in real-\ntime parameters. For warehouse picking and maintenance, this decreases the level of \nhuman error, increases efficiency and safety, and helps with indoor navigation\u2014like DHL \npartnering with Ricoh to implement vision picking at their facilities.\n\nAlso, utilizing mixed reality headsets provides more opportunities in automatic quality \ncontrol via image recognition, on-the-spot visualization of real-time data, work schedules, \netc. This provides another level of collaboration by supporting a multi-user environment \nwith shared contributed input.\n\nRemote assistance and collaboration\n\nHolographic meetings have yet to arrive, but there are still a number of ways that XR \nprovides better collaboration tools, especially in cases of digital content production. For \n\nhttps://vrscout.com/news/zara-ar-fashion-looks-stores/\nhttps://uploadvr.com/arkit-enabled-modiface-lets-try-makeup-buy/\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=2&v=I8vYrAUb0BQ\n\n\nwhitepaper | The Next Frontier: Extended Reality in Business 6\n\nexample, in the automotive industry, designers can collaborate in VR when they design \nwith the ability to interact with 3D models on the go. Doing so can greatly increase \nefficiency for distributed teams and enable a solid platform for providing feedback. BMW \nrecently announced that it will use HTC Vive and mixed reality headsets in its production \ninstead of laboriously constructed draft models, as it provides greater flexibility, faster \niterations, and lower costs.\n\nSpeaking of remote assistance, Microsoft HoloLens recently added out-of-box support, as \nit has high potential in engineering. Now highly qualified engineers can assist junior staff \nacross the globe to resolve complex production issues. This approach provides substantial \ncost savings for traveling and improves the availability of skilled resources. Additionally, \nmixed reality headsets enable easier sharing and collaboration on 2D and 3D content, as \nwell as the improved view of personalized data streams and analytics. \n\nIt\u2019s important to mention that headsets also meet important environmental and safety \nstandards and can be used actively in engineering. HoloLens has been tested and found to \nconform to the basic impact protection requirements of ANSI Z87.1, CSA Z94.3, and EN 166. \nAnother example of rugged enterprise glasses is Kopin Golden-i Infinity, which are IP-67 \nand MIL-STD. 810G certified.\n\nPremium service and experience\n\nExtended reality is on the verge of becoming a more premium option for customer \nservice. For example, in the airline industry, Air France rolled out a test run of in-flight VR \nentertainment for business class passengers. AlloSky is working on a headset specially \ndesigned for this purpose, making it lighter and more comfortable for long flights. \nUniversal, Disney, and Six Flags also partnered with Snapchat to provide geo-restricted \nlenses that enable a deeper connection between visitors and their characters. \n\nIn financial services, BNP Paribas and Bank of Kuwait explored options for virtual branches \nand VR personal assistants. XR can also provide enhanced support in the healthcare \nindustry where there is high demand for personalization and guidance.\n\nAnother option for VR is the live streaming of events. Next VR recently raised over \n$115 million in funding to create a platform for VR-streaming events and on-demand \nexperiences. This will allow users to access live events as if they\u2019re in the audience, from \nthe comfort of their homes.\n\nTIME TO BUILD\nThe massive potential for XR application is clear, what now?\n\nThrough the evolution of the technology and expansion of usage, the device market is \nfragmented into a number of sectors.\n\nhttps://www.press.bmwgroup.com/global/article/detail/T0258902EN/bmw-opts-to-incorporate-htc-vive-vr-headsets-and-mixed-reality-into-the-development-of-new-vehicle-models-computer-images-instead-of-laboriously-constructed-draft-models:-greater-flexibility-faster-results-and-lower-costs?language=en\nhttps://www.golden-i.com/\nhttps://www.travelandleisure.com/airlines-airports/airlines-using-allosky-vr-headsets\nhttps://group.bnpparibas/en/news/virtual-reality-step-future-banking\nhttps://nextvr.com/\n\n\nwhitepaper | The Next Frontier: Extended Reality in Business 7\n\nBesides headsets alone, there are accessory developments that should make experiences \ncloser to what we can see in futuristic movies like Ready Player One. These include:\n\n\u2022 Gloves. Usually with haptic feedback; they contribute to the ability to interact with \ndigital objects as if with the user\u2019s own hands, creating immersion on a higher level.\n\n\u2022 Trackers. These are placed on physical objects (like tools) to place an exact copy into the vir-\ntual world. This means an almost unlimited number of objects that people can interact with. \nAlso, placing trackers on a human body can enable acceptable tracking of the full body in VR.\n\n\u2022 Full body suits. Like the TeslaSuit, full body suits provide more precise full body \nmovement tracking, as well as haptic feedback and climate control. The suits broaden \nthe range of virtual interaction, though primary use cases are focused on the \nentertainment industry currently.\n\n\u2022 Gesture tracking systems. Based on camera and computer vision, these provide \nthe possibility of tracking hands without using additional equipment that could break \nimmersion. Leap Motion is a veteran on this field and is still improving. Systems like \nKinect allow the tracking not only gestures, but also full body movement.\n\n\u2022 Treadmills. Especially omnidirectional ones are good for simulating continuous movement \nin VR, with a number of successful applications in fitness and certain types of training.\n\n\u2022 Motion tracking systems. Allows the precise tracking of full body movement in large \nareas (more than 15x15 meters). In addition, certain configurations can be tracked \nseparately, such as tracking facial expressions. It requires a complex setup, but can be \nused to generate intricate custom animations and be a part of simulation system.

The \ndemand for cybersecurity professionals is at an all-time high\u2014the profession has an \nunemployment rate of zero. And it\u2019s predicted that by 2020, 100% of large enterprises will \nrequire annual cybersecurity and technology risk reporting to a board of directors.\n\nIt\u2019s safe to say that security is a big deal\u2014and growing more important every day.\n\nIf optimizing your business is about refinement and futureproofing, then doing the \nsame for your security means taking ownership of software, presently and proactively. \nThis pertains to legacy apps and systems requiring modernization, as well as ongoing \ndevelopment that ensures security management while delivering optimal experiences and \nactionable insights.\n\nAs a start, enterprise security fundamentals should be in place. These include: firewalls, \nIDS/IPS appliances, wireless security, and web/email application filtering. If these (and \nother fundamental security measures) are not already in place, it is premature to focus on \noptimization. \n\nHowever, speaking with our clients, there are three areas of security that are consistently \nmost pressing for those with even the most sophisticated security posture:\n\n1. Cloud security\n\n2. Application security assessments\n\n3. Compliance integrity preparation \n\nIn this white paper, we\u2019ll focus on these three areas while sharing insights on event \ndetection and vulnerability management. Most pressing for those with even the most\n\nVULNERABILIT\nY\n\nTH\nRE\n\nAT\nASSET\n\nRISK\n\n\n\nwhitepaper | Fortified Software Security 3\n\nThe security status quo isn't enough\n\nCause and effect: 99% of all cyber exploitation traffic is comprised of known vulnerabilities \n(preventable), which opens the door to 90% of all cyberattack claims stemming from \nhuman error or behavior (inevitable), as evidenced by 91% of all successful attacks \nbeginning with a phishing email (typical).\n\nRegular scans\u2014focused only on critical systems\u2014and reactive patch application is no \nlonger a viable, standalone, vulnerability management strategy.\n\nSecurity management is a layered challenge that requires a multifaceted approach, but the \njourney towards maturity and preparedness begins in part with:\n\n\u2022 Acknowledging current conditions\n\n\u2022 Resolving known issues\n\n\u2022 Paying attention to people and processes (as well as technology)\n\nAcknowledging current conditions\nThis is simply investing the time and resources in discovery to determine the \u201cgood, bad, \nand ugly\u201d of current strategy and readiness\u2014and then taking ownership of whatever is \nneeded to formulate and act on a security strategy that\u2019s right for you. There is no room \nfor excuses, procrastination, or de-prioritization. Breaches tend to cost far more (financially, \nsocially, and to your brand overall) than a systematic vulnerability management plan.\n\nResolving known issues\nIf the majority of cyberattacks occur with known issues, then logic dictates that a company \nendeavors to resolve these issues as quickly as possible. Why knowingly remain at risk if \nresolution is an option? As long as there are predatory cyber criminals, there will always be \nnew and improved issues\u2014but for the sake of your company, remove the threat(s) before \nthere are casualties.\n\nPeople and processes\nTechnology has come a long way, and will go a long way towards defending against \nattack, but human error will continue to be a \u201chole\u201d in the armor as long as people remain \nimperfect. You wouldn\u2019t hand the keys of an exotic sports car to an adolescent with no \nlicense, would you? Why would you make a significant investment in security and not \nensure that everyone within the company is properly trained, prepared, and on guard in \nsupport of your technological counter measures?\n\nIBM (one of our clients) provides a valuable reminder that resolving vulnerability also \ndepends on the IT asset and its role. There is no secret formula or checklist for everyone. \nPatching, disabling, uninstalling, changing configuration, and upgrading are each effective \n\nhttps://chiefexecutive.net/almost-90-cyber-attacks-caused-human-error-behavior/\nhttps://securityintelligence.com/assessing-risks-and-remediating-threats-with-a-layered-approach-to-vulnerability-management/\n\n\nwhitepaper | Fortified Software Security 4\n\nremediation options within a management program. However, the effectiveness of each of \nthese approaches depends entirely on context.\n\nNow let\u2019s dive into some of the biggest, current security concerns on the market.\n\nCloud security is no fluff\n\nMuch has been written on cloud security, and for good reason: it\u2019s the most pressing \ntopic in security today. This is largely due to a misconception that migration to the cloud \nwill render companies more vulnerable than staying put with onsite data storage. This \nerroneous paradigm is changing quickly, however\u2014spurred by the costs of inaction when \nbreaches occur, and bolstered by the realities that many companies face as they move to \nthe cloud.\n\nWith nearly 90% of security leaders making the move to the cloud, questions on cloud \nsecurity should dissipate rapidly\u2013with ample profit and loss incentives to do so.\n\nMigrating to the cloud is simply moving from an existing datacenter to a more secure \nexternal one. AWS, Google, and Microsoft offer platforms much more powerful and secure \nthan most legacy options, but it is important to recognize that these platforms will allow \nalmost \u201canything\u201d installed in the virtual machine. The security model for cloud providers \nisn\u2019t a one-size-fits-all, but rather a shared responsibility model, in which both the business \nand the cloud provider share security.\n\nIn short, the greatest vehicle is ultimately only as good as the driver, tuning, and \nmaintenance schedule. To get the most from a cloud migration, the inherent platform \nsecurity requires a team of specialists capable of not only maintenance, but also \ncustomization and fine tuning (optimization). For example, SoftServe specializes in areas \nlike egress/ingress point security, allowing our clients to have a better analysis of what \ndata is actually moving in and out of their cloud infrastructure. This allows them to dive \ndeeper into their cloud capabilities in a highly customized and optimized fashion.\n\nof business leaders are employing \na multi-cloud strategy \n(Forrester)\n\n\n\nwhitepaper | Fortified Software Security 5\n\nCloud security is no fluff\n\nThe battle against cyberattacks is real and ongoing\u2014but far better to assess and ensure \nsecurity prior to release than discover vulnerabilities after the fact. And for legacy \nsoftware, there\u2019s no better time than the present.\n\nDevelopers generally don\u2019t like to work with legacy software for numerous reasons\u2014\nassumed vulnerability, likelihood of vulnerability, and someone else\u2019s work\u2014but net new \ndevelopment is not always an option, or what\u2019s necessarily best for the company.\n\nAn assessment is key because it\u2019s impossible to know where to go or how best to get there \nwithout knowing the current state of your software.\n\nThere are two prefaces to assessing (and ensuring) inherent security in DevOps:\n\n1. Stop viewing security as a non-functional requirement\n\n2. Insist on agile security practices and tools\n\nAt SoftServe, we pride ourselves on being agile and fluid. We recommend the same when \nbuilding a security culture. Net new development should be inherently secure throughout \nthe process. There are a number of ways to ensure this including: putting developers in \ncharge of secure development, continuous integration security practices in the SDLC, and \nbuilding user stories.\n\nIn addition to the full-time effort teams should dedicate to vulnerability management, \nsecurity should be inherently built into every project from inception to PoC to launch. For \nlegacy systems, a software security assessment is vital to know the best course of action, \nand outside expertise should be leveraged if necessary to make it so.\n\n\u201cOnly one third of organizations believe they have adequate resources to \nmanage security effectively.\u201d \n\n(Ponemon Institute)\n\n\n\nwhitepaper | Fortified Software Security 6\n\nResistance is futile\u2014compliance is mandatory\n\nSecurity and compliance are often grouped together, but distinguishing them from one \nanother is important. Being compliant, for example, does not necessarily ensure security. \nBut establishing security within compliance is imperative, especially in the wake of new \nregulations such as GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation).\n\nGDPR is the first wave of a sweeping regulation, but more sophisticated, geographic-\nspecific changes are on the way. This trend may be seen with companies affected by GDPR \nas well, considering more than half of GDPR affected companies will likely be noncompliant \nby end of year. In the US, this trend is called a \u201ccompliance salad\u201d where different versions \nof websites are produced based on variable compliance standards from state to state.\n\nThose without adequate resources to manage both security and compliance effectively \nshould seek outside expertise sooner than later. Once a company can check all regulatory \nboxes, optimizing applicable security is the next step.\n\nAt SoftServe, for example, we guide our clients to improve digital maturity and security \nposture so that when it\u2019s time to be certified, the process is streamlined and simple\u2014test \npreparation if you will. And where multiple contractors are employed, our experts provide \nredundant verification to ensure the work of others is properly driving certification as well.\n\nSecurity is in our DNA \n\nCloud security, risk assessment, and compliance readiness are only a few of the security \nchallenges facing most businesses today. Identifying where your security stands, where it \nneeds to go, and how to get there can literally be a million-dollar question.\n\nDifferent industries have different regulations that require different preparedness \nstrategies. Sometimes modernizing legacy software is enough, but oftentimes it is not. \nThere is no one-size-fits-all solution in a world where cyber criminals are in a perpetual \nchess match with developers, ethical hackers, and other security professionals.\n\nSoftServe\u2019s methodology for each client and project is secure by design and has been for \nover 25 years.

The common requirements for the sensors are a small size and access to \nthe main power source. Challenges around this can be seen across numerous industry \nverticals where battery efficiency is essential for cost effectiveness and business \ncontinuity. For example, the oil and gas industry commonly requires data gathering from \ninfrastructure where the battery replacement is very expensive and time consuming. \nAdditionally,  transportation and logistics services need real-time tracking capabilities of \nthe high value cargo, requiring reliable, continuous power for these trackers over their \nlifetime.\n\nProject Description\n\nSoftServe\u2019s TegBand Project demonstrates the ability to use this ambient thermal energy \nfor power harvesting to run battery free applications. The device prototype built into a \nband format works from the heat of the human body. It validates the concept of battery \nfree devices that can be used to execute communication and sensing tasks.\n\nThe harvested energy is stored in the single 1.5mF tantalum capacitor. The power level \nis sufficient to power a microcontroller unit (MCU), digital sensor, and LED; as well as \nmeasure the environmental condition, support communication with the smartphone, \nand provide visual feedback to the user.\n\nValue Delivered\n\nThermal energy harvesting provides stable power output with the presence of a \ntemperature gradient with an efficiency greater than that produced by ambient radio or \nvibration.\n\nSoftServe\u2019s TegBand application holds the potential to power wearable devices in battery \nfree environments to monitor systems with zero cost maintenance.\n\n\n\nABOUT US\nSoftServe is a digital authority that advises and provides at the \ncutting-edge of technology.

The long-term CDR DW \nsolution would help capture the company\u2019s usage and generate reports on the necessary \ndetails required to ensure correct billing; provide cost transparency and perform usage & cost \nanalysis. The client chose to partner with SoftServe to design and implement the solution.\n\nSolution\n\nSoftServe\u2019s team of 4 experts: Project Manager, Technical Lead, Senior and Mid-level \nDevelopers, had to accomplish a range of projects to meet the following requirements:\n\n \u2022 Ensure that Voice Services were provided by a single vendor\n \u2022 Help the client establish full control over the consumption and spend management\n \u2022 Facilitate reporting on cost management, load balancing, fraud detection, etc.\n\nThe project was completed in four phases:\n\n1. Discovery phase\n \u2022 CDR Data Warehouse solution big picture and architecture drivers\n \u2022 Conceptual and Logical data model\n \u2022 Data integration vision\n \u2022 Technology stack selection and trade-offs\n\n2. Core Development - Designing DWH & ETL processes\n3. Designing the solution for Rating Engine integration (Billing)\n4. Developing specific features for processing call records\n\nEvery stage of the project was preliminary discussed with the client and then presented in the \nform of regular demos of the ongoing processes.\n\nBusiness Value\n\nSoftServe created and implemented a solution that is able to conduct 4,000,000 voice calls per \nday and 10 years of data retention. The benefits for the client included:\n\n \u2022 Full control over the consumption and improved decision making\n \u2022 Ability to collect and integrate statistics of CDR data from a variety of RIG devices\n\n2case study | Solution Gives Financial Corporation Consistent Reporting and Trend Analysis\n\n\n\nABOUT US\n\nSoftServe is a global digital authority and consulting company, operating at \nthe cutting edge of technology.

Its cloud-based Canvas learning management \nsystem (LMS) now connects more than 18 million teachers and learners at over 1,200 higher \neducation and K-12 institutions throughout the world. Because learning does not end \nafter graduation, our client also offers a modern learning and engagement platform that \nenables organizations of every kind to engage with employees by measuring and improving \nemployee sentiment, alignment, and knowledge in real time.\n\nBusiness Challenge\n\nOur client needed to enable integration of its Canvas Learning Management System with \nthe Student Information System. The project consisted of three parts:\n\n\u2022 SIS Aeries Integration. Develop a solution that enables integration of the Student \nInformation System with Canvas LMS (Learning Management System) and provide \nowners of SIS with an automated process for the import/update of data from SIS (such \nas courses, terms, sections, students, and teachers).\n\nINTEGRATION OF CLOUD-BASED \nLEARNING MANAGEMENT SYSTEM \nWITH STUDENT INFORMATION SYSTEM\n\n\n\ncase study |    Integration of Cloud-Based Learning Management System with Student Information System 2\n\n\u2022 SIS Aspire Integration (Integration with SIS Aspire which is used by Nebo School). \nDevelop an assignment-level grade-pass backward integration between Canvas and \nschool district SIS. This integration required the development of a middleware solution \nwith direct read/write access to the SIS database.\n\n\u2022 Flexible Learning LTI Application. Develop an LTI application that allows the client to \noffer students a flexible learning format of self-paced academic credit program. The \ngoal was to enable students to progress through the course content provided and \ncomplete the course at their own pace.\n\nProject Description\n\nSoftServe and the client partnered to create 3 integrations of the Canvas system with the SIS \nsystem. SIS integrations were performed using a SIS API and custom integrations provided \nby the client to retrieve, process, and format the SIS data to adhere to Canvas. One of the \nintegrations was aimed at the development of an LTI application, which provides students \nwith flexible learning plans including progress reports and a variety of notifications.\n\nWithin a short 3 month timeframe, the SoftServe team successfully executed all three \nprojects. The team consisted of 3 Ruby developers, a Quality Control engineer, Project \nManager, Requirements Manager, and System Architect. Thanks to the flexibility and \nvalue stream mapping approach, the SoftServe team was able to work on the integrations \nsimultaneously in order to:\n\n\u2022 Meet the project\u2019s requirements within the limited timeframe\n\u2022 Build the vision of the future solution\n\u2022 Provide a full set of project deliverables\n\n20\n\n15\n\n10\n\n5\n\n0\n\n\n\ncase study |    Integration of Cloud-Based Learning Management System with Student Information System 3\n\nBusiness Value \n\nAs a result of the three projects, Canvas now supports integrations with the SIS. These \nintegrations allow instructors who use the application to pass the information to Canvas \nand use it on both account and sub-account levels. Teachers who use the application can \ntransfer data and use the full set of Canvas features, receiving up to date information from \nthe SIS system.\n\nWith the Flexible Learning LTI application our client offers their clients a versatile way to \nmanage the Master Schedule of a course, as well as the opportunity to modify the study \nplan for a specific student.\n\nAlso, a Teacher/Admin can modify a master schedule by section at any time. Upon \nenrollment of a new student into the section, the system automatically calculates and \nsets custom assignment due dates for the student so that student\u2019s course calendar and \nagenda are updated in near real-time after enrollment.\n\nLastly, a Teacher/Admin can modify individual student study plans by changing the actual \ndate of each individual due date, including the course end date. In addition, extensive \nstatistics on student achievement is now available via reports and a variety of notifications \nfor users who can access a specific course.\n\nQ\n\n\n\nABOUT US\nSoftServe is a digital authority that advises and provides at the \ncutting-edge of technology.

The main \ngoal was to help educators identify students that have a high probability of dropping \nout of school prior to graduation. The secondary goal was to provide educators with \ninformation on the students\u2019 progress to help them monitor as well as solve issues that \nwere causing students to drop out of school.\n\nWhile Pearson had a Flex-based application prototype, the application backend needed \nimproved performance and scalability to satisfy the education market needs. The Pearson \nand SoftServe teams collaborated to complete the following:\n\n\u2022 Keep the same look and feel as the existing application\n\u2022 Add new features to the backend system (multi-tenancy, scalability, reporting,  \n\nand integration with the school\u2019s information system)\n\u2022 Ensure support for different browsers (IE, Firefox, Safari and Chrome) and mobile \n\ndevices like iPad\n\nProject Description\n\nSoftServe identified a number of challenges, including absence of specific application \nrequirements and need for improvements of the infrastructure and architecture. There \nwas also a very short timeframe of three months for completion of the engagement.\n\nThe combined teams held a series of assessments and delivered the following:\n\n\u2022 Implementation Roadmap\n\u2022 Architecture solution and technology stack\n\u2022 Revised and prioritized requirements with detailed scope for first release\n\u2022 UI/UX enhancement recommendations\n\u2022 Test Strategy and Test Design\n\u2022 Revised development process\n \nAs a part of the SaaS consulting service, SoftServe created a System Prototype as a proof \nof concept for the application.\n\nThe newly developed product application named \u201cPrevent 2.0\u201d was built on a multi-\ntier SaaS architecture, which allowed tenants/users to start using services without the \ninstallation process. The SaaS teams deployed \u201cPrevent 2.0\u201d in a product environment \nhosted by Rackspace, and delivered a scalable and fault-tolerant multi-tenant application \nwith high availability. In addition, \u201cPrevent 2.0\u201d was delivered as a fully functional \napplication with support of mobile devices, including iPad. For ease of use, the product \nwas integrated with line of business applications using a Single Sign-On approach.\n\nBusiness Value\n\n\n\ncase study |    Educational SaaS Application for Pearson 3\n\nThe key factor of success for this solution was that it was completed and implemented  \nfor general availability by the beginning of the school year. Otherwise, Pearson would \nhave lost a full year of market presence for their new product. The \u201cPrevent 2.0\u201d \napplication used new web-based code and provided an enhanced cross-browser front-\nend resulting in:\n\n\u2022 Improved usability due to incorporating new UI/UX approaches\n\u2022 Increased overall performance due to utilizing asynchronous Ajax requests\n\u2022 Flexibility of application usage from different access points, increasing the users\u2019 \n\nmobility \n\nThe collaborative efforts of Pearson and SoftServe launched the \u201cPrevent 2.0\u201d application \nbefore the start of the school year; and it was the first application for an education \nsystem on SaaS platform in the United States.\n\n\n\nABOUT US\nSoftServe is a digital authority that advises and provides at the \ncutting-edge of technology.

Some will see the end of banking as we know it. \nOthers foresee the transformation of the financial services industry. \n\nIt is likely that both visions are accurate, to some degree.\n\nChanges in the market\n\nSome of the new market entrants gaining momentum pose an existential risk to established \nplayers. The disintermediation of banks and the emergence of new payment systems and \nvirtual currencies promise to revolutionize the financial services ecosystem from end to end. \n\nA mere catalogue of impending technological and regulatory changes is enough to shake \nthe complacency of any thinking banker. Financial services are now being provided by \nnew market entrants\u2014not just challenger banks but lenders, financial managers, and \nmoney management apps. \n\nBitcoin, blockchain, and distributed ledger technology (DLT) have already demonstrated \nthe potential to upend long-established payment service patterns. So-called \u201crobo\u201d \nadvisory services promise to be a huge growth area. According to Business Insider,\n60% of high net-worth individuals are projected to invest 20% of their assets in robo \nadvisors by 2020, equating approximately $6.4 trillion.\n\nAdd in the regulatory revolution being driven in Europe by the GDPR (General Data \nProtection Regulation) and PSD2 (the revised Payment Services Directive), which are set \nto accelerate digital disruption by driving banks to choose whether they intend to become \na banking \u201cutility,\u201d or an \u201ceveryday bank\u201d playing a central role in customers\u2019 daily lives.\n\nChanges in consumer attitudes\n\nAll these changes come on top of well-recognized trends in consumer sentiment. US and \nUK consumers appear ready to rate tech companies such as PayPal and Amazon equal \nto banks as agents for their money, and would consider buying financial products from \ntechnology companies they currently use. Amazon alone has supplied $3 billion to \nvenders on its marketplace platform since 2012, when it launched a lending pilot.\n\nhttp://www.businessinsider.com/4-reasons-robo-investing-growing-2017-1\nhttps://info.softserveinc.com/are-you-ready-for-gdpr\nhttps://info.softserveinc.com/are-you-ready-for-gdpr\nhttps://www.ft.com/content/b45c0008-4bc1-11e7-919a-1e14ce4af89b\n\n\nwhitepaper | What if Banks Go the Way of the Neighborhood Grocer? 3\n\nMany customers prefer digital channels to branch channels, but feel that the current digital \nservice by banks falls far short of expectations. In most countries, banks have far to go in \nshifting to digital channels; for example, the number of customers prepared to use voice \nassistants for banking could grow sharply, but that technology is being driven by tech \nplayers rather than by banks.\n\nDigital is beyond debate\n\nAttempting to predict how these multiple forces play out is a useless exercise. But regardless \nof how innovations are going to disrupt the banking marketplace, or which technologies or \ncurrencies will dominate, this much is beyond discussion: the digital customer experience \nwill be at the center of any and every banking relationship going forward. \n\nThe emergence of artificial intelligence and machine learning technology presents a very \nexciting opportunity for our clients to automate customized experiences and provide \nvaluable insights for their customers. The question we\u2019re helping to answer is how to turn \ndecades of technical debt into an advantage for the future.\n\nWhich is why financial institutions are looking to understand their customers better. They \nare looking to offer customers the best service possible through faster, frictionless tools \nand customized options that don\u2019t require gratuitous actions; by remaining paperless \nand actionable within the confines of a phone screen. As customers get used to intuitive, \nseamless, and secure experiences from tech giants, banks are being challenged to deliver \ncompelling customer experiences that meet increasingly sophisticated expectations. \nChallenger banks are adopting this with AI-driven chatbots that interact with customers, \naddress their queries, and help with financial transactions.\n \n\n\n\nwhitepaper | What if Banks Go the Way of the Neighborhood Grocer? 4\n\nUsing digital to drive customer engagement\n\nPutting digital at the center of the banking relationship requires facing up to some \nuncomfortable questions:\n\n\u2022 If my customers and my competitors are evolving faster than I am to capture market \nshare, how do I catch up? \n\n\u2022 Does my financial enterprise have the digital expertise to drive better, deeper \ncustomer engagement?\n\n\u2022 Now that I have my data in one place, how can I leverage it to get greater insights into \nmy customers, keep them, and attract new ones? \n\nMany banks have already centralized their data, enabling them to explore innovative \nways to highlight what really matters in driving customer satisfaction and improve the \noverall customer experience. \n\nBut does your team know how to leverage your data to deliver exceptional experiences? \nHow will you design a personalized experience for your customers? \n\nProviding customers with personalized interactions promises to:\n\n\u2022 Utilize existing data to increase sales;\n\u2022 Uncover new business opportunities based on the current operational model; and\n\u2022 Understand what other vendors and start-ups are doing in your market, so that you \n\ncan partner with them rather than compete against them.\n\nNew digital technologies are not only disrupting traditional sources of competitiveness, \nbut are raising the bar on what\u2019s possible and setting new benchmarks for cost reduction. \nCloud-based services and the \u201ceverything-as-a-service\u201d model can redefine how \ninvestment banks approach operating models and IT systems. But do traditional banks \nhave the in-house skills needed? Where is the design thinking, experience design, business \nprocess modeling, iteration, and lean thinking?\n\n\n\nwhitepaper | What if Banks Go the Way of the Neighborhood Grocer? 5\n\nUsing digital to drive enterprise transformation\n\nThat said, digital banking should not stop with customer engagement. Ultimately, the \ndigital agenda needs to drive enterprise transformation. Is your technical debt costing you \nmore than you realize? What impact does maintaining the old have on building\nthe new? Most banks need to reduce the overhead of IT to run the business more\neffectively, including:\n\n\u2022 Increasing operational performance\n\u2022 Mitigating risk of technological debt of legacy systems\n\u2022 Redesigning internal legacy systems and internal legacy software development processes\n\u2022 Partnering with software development experts \n\u2022 Gaining access to best practices and deep technology competence\n\u2022 Embracing and implementing an agile approach for an internal software \n\ndevelopment lifecycle\n\nThe new, emerging digital ecosystem could offer many opportunities to help reduce \ncosts and generate new revenues\u2014but this requires a strategic approach to technology \ninvestments. Specifically, companies could focus on:\n\n\u2022 Fintech partnerships to supplement their offerings and increase efficiency\n\u2022 Big data and predictive analytics to enable greater customer insight and responsiveness\n\u2022 Artificial intelligence to automate complex tasks that involve non-structured data and \n\nrequire learning algorithms\n\u2022 Distributed ledger technology to deliver efficiency in areas such as cross-border \n\npayments, liquidity management, collateral management, syndicated loans, trade \nfinance and securities settlements\n\n\n\nwhitepaper | What if Banks Go the Way of the Neighborhood Grocer? 6\n\nBank on IT experience\n\nSoftServe is already working with banking clients today to solve unique solutions to \nmany of these challenges. \n\nSome of our projects include:\n\n\u2022  Developing a tool for a leading US bank that enables customers to open different \ntypes of bank accounts through a single, new web application, omitting the need for \nbrick-and-mortar communication models.\n\n\u2022  Developing a unified electronic system for an urban center utility, improving \nprocesses for automating payments while increasing customer satisfaction and revenues.\n\n\u2022  Building business and tech requirements for a European bank who need to \nconsolidate multiple information systems and databases to sell bank products.\n\n\u2022 Researching and modeling \u201ctoken economics\u201d for an Asian physical commodity \nexchange leveraging blockchain technology, analyzing how agents within the ecosystem \ninteracted in certain scenarios.\n\nWe are doing all this today.

In today\u2019s rapidly evolving \nmarketplace, if it\u2019s not personal, there is no business. Tailored experiences are rightfully \ngiven attention by marketing experts and industry leaders alike, however, the discussion \nis still often predicated on \u201cbusiness as usual\u201d marketing practices. It\u2019s time to make \nmarketing personal.\n\nConsumer insistence on personalization is rising quickly. According to Forrester, 89 percent \nof digital businesses are investing in personalization, but over one third of U.S. online \nshoppers agree that retailers should do more to offer personalized experiences. So why \nthe disconnect between brand intent and customer reality?\n\nToday\u2019s consumer is attention deficient. More than ever it\u2019s imperative that a message \ncaptures her attention in three seconds or less. To accomplish that while delivering a truly \npersonal experience a brand must know the individual, proactively anticipate her wants \nand needs, and then deliver on-demand service in real time.  That\u2019s personalization at \nscale. Companies must analyze and address this challenge differently while moving from \nlegacy processes and technology, to current and future leaning capabilities. \n\nUltimately, it\u2019s about thinking, planning, and preparing for the moments of truth when a \nconsumer decides if a marketing message is relevant. If not, there\u2019s no guarantee a brand \nwill get another chance.\n\nIn this white paper we\u2019ll look at how personalization has changed and why big data, artificial \nintelligence (AI), and machine learning (ML) should be driving Personalization 2.0 efforts.\n\nLooking back before moving forward\n\nIn the past personalization meant including a customer\u2019s name on mass-mailed form \nletters, each with the recipient\u2019s name inserted in the salutation. For its time, this \nmethodology was a positive step forward in marketing automation as indicated by the \nincreased response rates generated.\n\nSegmentation was a foundational tool for the mass marketing that was meant to \npersonalize by dividing the populace into demographically-, psychographically-, and \ngeographically-defined groups appearing to share commonalities. There was a time when \nthis was the most effective approach, but segmentation\u2019s efficacy has been perpetually \ndiminished by consumers who resist labels, define what a brand is or isn\u2019t, and dictate \nrelevance like never before.\n\n\n\nwhitepaper | Earn Fan Loyalty with Personalization 2.0 3\n\nDespite ongoing reliance on bulk mail and segmentation-centric marketing, the use of \npast tense is intentional as these techniques are remnants of the past, quickly losing \nviability as technology leaves them behind. Fortunately, wasted dollars due to inefficient \nengagement (related to impersonal experiences) is more preventable than ever thanks to \nevolving consumer understanding. Today\u2019s data sources provide unique insights into \nindividual consumers that eliminate the need to assume that one person within a segment \nlooks, thinks, and purchases like another. This ideal isn\u2019t revelatory, but reliance on legacy \nsegmentation and personalization persists, most often due to a lack of technical expertise, \ncapacity, or combination of both.\n\nWhat is Personalization 2.0?\n\nCoined by Forrester\u2019s Brendan Witcher, the term refers to the migration away from a \nsegmentation-driven strategy in favor of real-time preferences across multiple channels \nand devices. For example, consider an expectant mother\u2014as identified by her recent app, \nsocial, and shopping history. It is far more personal to deliver an in-the-moment mobile \noffer inside the store and in close proximity to a nursery item, than if that same offer was \nsent to all women who have made baby-related purchases within a designated marketing \narea\u2014regardless of location, expressed interest, or current activity. \n\nExamples of the Personalization 2.0 evolution include:\n\n\u201cIndividualization is the new North Star for personalization.\u201d \n(Forrester)\n\n\n\nwhitepaper | Earn Fan Loyalty with Personalization 2.0 4\n\n\u2022 Amazon sets the standard for proactive recommendations based on historical data\n\u2022 Starbucks gamified its mobile app offering loyalty rewards and custom ordering\n\u2022 Coca-Cola increased sales for the first time in over a decade with #shareacoke\n\u2022 Virgin Hotels created a synergistic app and guest program for hyper-customized stays\n\u2022 Sephora was voted #1 on Sailthru\u2019s first annual Retail Personalization Index\n\nBrand loyalty comes from true fans\u2014a coveted group whose loyalty has moved beyond \na simple like, follow, or reoccurring order. To capture, retain, and grow a fanbase requires \ngenuine personalization based on the individual and driven by digital innovation. \n\nStart with quality data\n\nData is the fuel for AI-driven technology, so regardless of how \u201cbig\u201d a data set is, a \ncompany\u2019s initial emphasis must begin with quality over quantity. Silo removal and the \nconsolidation of disparate data should be a focus from the outset, and quality should be \nmeasured by contextual compliance with user- or statistic-defined rules that are based on \ncorporate knowledge, business processes, and other conditions. For example: a company \ncould have multiple rules across divisions, languages, etc.\n\nIssues with data quality typically stem from system-level processes failure, poor software \nimplementation, or changes in data format that adversely impact source and/or target \ndata stores. For a system to be AI-ready, it must be designed to anticipate data feed and \nquality issues, with the proper responses already in place. \n\nWhat does that look like? An optimized system properly managing data input/output will \ninstantly identify quality threats and prevent cross-contamination with poor data, while \nnotifying appropriate users and denying access if necessary.\n\nOnce the foundations for quality data management are in place, proper data accumulation \ncan be achieved through optimized first-party data management, strategic second-party \ndata acquisition (purchased or shared), and properly vetted third-party data purchasing.\n\nLOYAL\nCUSTOMERS ARE\n\n5x\n\n5x\n\n7x\n\n4x\n\nMore likely to\nrepurchase.\n\nMore likely\nto forgive.\n\nMore likely to try\na new offering.\n\nMore likely\nto refer.\n\nhttp://www.businessinsider.com/sephora-leads-the-way-in-personalization-2017-9\n\n\nwhitepaper | Earn Fan Loyalty with Personalization 2.0 5\n\nUse AI to unlock potential\n\nWithout quality data, personalization accuracy is compromised. There aren\u2019t enough hours \nin a day to manually track the perpetually changing location, behavior, and context data \nthat consumers generate on a daily basis. Without these insights, however, companies are \nlimited to delivering experiences and content based on personas and segmentation\u2014not \nthe individual and her personal profile.\n\nArtificial intelligence empowers a company to automate:\n\n\u2022 Complex data tracking\n\u2022 Creation of unique customer profiles that update in real time\n\u2022 Profile data analysis for relevant content delivery and personalization\n\nAI can also alleviate corporate \u201cparalysis from analysis.\" The quest for bigger data \nmay delay or even prevent action at times due to the time and resources required to \naccumulate, sort, and scrub it. But with the speed at which today\u2019s marketplace is moving, \nthere\u2019s no time to waste. Artificial intelligence powers a growing list of technologies that \noptimize operations and processes allowing teams to focus talent and effort elsewhere.\n\nMachine learning is an excellent example of this.\n\nPersonalize at scale with machine learning\n\nWhy? Because it is impossible to personalize at scale without ML. \n\nImagine sending a unique tweet to each follower, crafting a Facebook ad for an audience of \none, or sending a custom mobile offer to every fan across the country\u2014one at a time. That\u2019s \nthe effort required for an individualistic, personalized approach and clearly, it\u2019s not feasible.\n\nML has largely untapped potential to identify value points, empower rapid response, and \ninform every tactical and creative aspect of genuine personalization. This fact is not lost \non the corporate majority according to MemSql as 61% of all companies, regardless of \nsize, see AI and ML as the most significant data initiatives for 2019. Meanwhile, industry \nleaders like Amazon, Google, and Microsoft already have a wide-margin lead in AI and ML \ntechnology investment that will only grow the longer a company waits to commit.\n\nNext steps\n\nCustom headlines and copy are no longer viable personalization for earning customer \nengagement in our content-saturated, attention-deficient society. As adblocking statistics \nclearly demonstrate, users dictate relevance\u2014or if marketing will be seen at all. The goal \nmust be to deliver content that is so compelling, it can\u2019t be ignored.\n\nhttps://globenewswire.com/news-release/2018/02/07/1335563/0/en/Survey-Finds-Machine-Learning-and-Artificial-Intelligence-are-Top-Business-Priorities.html\nhttps://www.forbes.com/forbes/welcome/?toURL=https://www.forbes.com/sites/louiscolumbus/2018/02/18/roundup-of-machine-learning-forecasts-and-market-estimates-2018/&refURL=&referrer=#70e752502225\nhttps://www.statista.com/statistics/804008/ad-blocking-reach-usage-us/\n\n\nwhitepaper | Earn Fan Loyalty with Personalization 2.0 6\n\nAt SoftServe, we are passionate advisors and providers of personalization strategy \nthrough big data, AI, and ML.

Digital retail is doing everything \nto make the customer journey as intelligent as possible, while physical retail is moving \nheaven and earth to enrich the customer\u2019s physical and digital experiences.\n\nThe common theme running through many innovations on the near horizon is the power \nof connecting: richer-than-ever data and analytics, exhilarating in-store tech, and a slew \nof new tools retailers can use to connect with customers. 2019 is shaping up to be a year \nenergized with the possibility of brilliant connections, smarter customer insights, and \ninnovative customer experiences in both the digital and physical arenas. Here is a preview.\n\nRebuilding brick-and-mortar: Better, faster, smarter\n\nAs every retailer feels the pressure from Amazon\u2019s prices and delivery speed, physical \nstores are being forced to reinvent themselves to survive and remain relevant within \ntheir category. The good news is that brick-and-mortar stores are making a come-back. \nAmazon has topped the ranking of leading retailers in the UK since 2011, but a current \nBritish consumer sentiment study shows traditional storefronts dominating the 30 most \npopular UK retailers, with Amazon slipping to fourth position, after M&S Simply Food, \nJohn Lewis, and LUSH. \n\nAt the core of this transformation are brilliant physical-digital synergies, offering impactful \nin-store environments. Studies show that many customers are \u201cwebrooming,\u201d i.e. doing \ntheir research digitally before heading into a physical store to purchase the item they \nfound online, because they want to see what they are paying for in real life.

An offshoot of the \nAmerican department store mega-brand, Nordstrom Local is a 3,000 sq. ft. concept store \ndesigned as a \u201cneighborhood hub\u201d for Los Angeles. Instead of a full-stock inventory, it \nhas manicure stations, a juice bar, comfortable hangout space, and a suite of personal \nstylists on hand. Customers call ahead to book an appointment and are invited to build a \nPinterest-style inspiration board. \n\nStory is another example of the lengths to which retailers will go to connect with \ncustomers by creating fresh new retail experiences. This retailer literally reinvents its \nstore layout and inventory every four to eight weeks so that it can \u201ctell a fresh story\u201d to its \ncustomers. The concept has attracted interest and imitation from Timberland, Target, and \nother major retail chains, including Macy\u2019s, which recently acquired Story. \n\nOfferMoments has developed dynamic billboards that change as customers walk by. They \nturn digital screens into an interactive experience with ads customized to each customer. \nFor example, a mannequin in a retailer\u2019s window display could carry a sensor that \u201ctalks\u201d \nto the smartphones of passersby, enabling the store to send each person a personalized \noffer. It could also mean smart digital screens that use facial recognition to identify the \ncustomer and change the display to something tailored to them based on customer data.\n\nAI and retail: Make it work\n\nNot long ago, marketers and retailers structured communication with customers around \ngross demographic measures such as age, gender, income, and postal code. Today\u2019s \nretailers are using much smarter tech tools to understand customer wants and needs \non a granular level. The main challenge is scaling the one-on-one personal approach to \ninteractions in the millions. This ambitious task would be insurmountable without the \nemergence of artificial intelligence (AI). \n\nAI is one of the top five tech priorities of retailers in 2018, according to Forrester Research. \nA recent Google study also shows that successful marketers and retailers are actively \nemploying AI technologies to connect first-party data across all touchpoints, systems, \ndatabases, websites, and channels: \n\nhttps://www.insider-trends.com/top-25-examples-internet-things-retail/\nhttps://www.forbes.com/sites/richardkestenbaum/2018/01/28/this-is-what-the-retail-industry-is-talking-about-now/#5d60906f7680\nhttps://www.forbes.com/sites/pamdanziger/2017/12/18/story-based-retail-and-the-evolving-role-of-merchandiser/#750e02e26c20\nhttps://www.insider-trends.com/top-25-examples-internet-things-retail/\nhttps://www.forrester.com/report/The+Top+Retail+Technology+Investments+In+2018/-/E-RES139936\nhttps://www.thinkwithgoogle.com/marketing-resources/data-measurement/machine-learning-customer-journey/\n\n\nwhitepaper | A Year for Brilliant Connections 4\n\n\u2022 72% of leading marketers are investing in improving their first-party data capture. \n\n\u2022 81% agree that machine learning will be critical for personalized customer experiences. \n\n\u2022 89% know that anticipating customer needs is critical for growth.\n\nBuilding on this foundation of richer data, AI also helps retailers build more brilliant brands \nthat recognize patterns within data, use automation to efficiently process data flows, and \nleverage predictive models to deeply understand consumer behavior. \n\nWhat does this process look like in practice? Consider high-end retailer Neiman Marcus, \namong today\u2019s trend leaders, using AI and machine learning to triangulate information \nfrom multiple data sources to predict customers\u2019 needs. The ultimate goal is what the \ncompany calls \u201cseamless retail,\u201d where the customer journey is smooth, memorable, and \nwell assisted on all devices, across all touchpoints, at all times. \n\nOther forward-thinking designers such as Tommy Hilfiger, Rebecca Minkoff, and \nCharlotte Tilbury are also crunching data and experimenting with technology to create \npersonalized, experiential stores of the future. During an average five-minute online \nsession at luxury e-commerce site Farfetch in the UK, 15,000 data points are collected on \neach shopper. This amount of data allows Farfetch to provide an advanced, personalized \nexperience for shoppers. \n\nTrying on IoT\n\nInternet of things (IoT) applications are another area where retailers are experimenting. \nTo provide customers with positive, memorable experiences, retailers are combining \nIoT apps with AI-powered analytics. In smart stores, mall traffic can be analyzed across \nseveral retailers to understand the total shopping journey and to customize the in-store \nexperience. With more customers expecting merchandise deliveries overnight, moving \nmerchandise more efficiently is one of the goals of smart transportation apps in retail, \nwhich optimize transport, tracking, and routing. \n\nBut again, how do these promising technologies perform in real life? When Amazon Go \nis fully operational, customers will place items in their baskets and simply walk out of \nthe store when they finish \u201cshopping.\u201d Tags on the products, in the baskets, and at the \nstore entrance are read automatically by the peripheral technology, and the customer\u2019s \nAmazon account is charged without the need to queue at the checkout. Since launching \nan automated packaging service in 2016, Ocado has been able to control and coordinate \n\nhttps://www.forbes.com/sites/jasonbloomberg/2017/11/21/neiman-marcus-maintaining-the-personal-touch-in-a-digital-world/#63c2d82bbf7e\nhttps://howtospendit.ft.com/womens-style/202881-inside-the-shops-of-the-future\nhttps://www.insider-trends.com/top-25-examples-internet-things-retail/\nhttps://www.insider-trends.com/top-25-examples-internet-things-retail/\n\n\nwhitepaper | A Year for Brilliant Connections 5\n\nthe movements of millions of grocery store items and thus accelerate the bagging process \nwhen an online order is made. More than one thousand robots scan thousands of crates \ncontaining a selection of over 47,000 items. \n\nAccording to Global Market Insights, voice shopping with the help of smart speakers such \nas Google Home and Amazon\u2019s Echo will be commonplace by 2024, with over 100 million \nunits sold. The Trade Marketing in Transition report names voice activated assistants like \nAlexa and Google along with the devices that feature them as \u201cthe retail technologies of \ngreatest interest.\u201d \n\nStaying connected with security\n\nWhile trailblazing is key for future retail success, experimentation is not a standalone \nactivity. With security breaches in the news on a daily basis, retailers appreciate the \nneed for robust security. Target made headlines and lost $162 million because it failed to \nproperly secure customer credit card data, resulting in over 70 million customers being \naffected by a breach. In June 2018, Macy's and Adidas both had to deal with security \nbreaches and go public with them. \n\nAs a result, while making a connection with customers is a retailer\u2019s first priority, \nretaining that trust depends on security practices and technologies. The extensive \nvolumes of customer data now being gathered by retailers make them an even more \nattractive target for hackers and other malicious agents looking to benefit from the sale \nof stolen data or demanding ransom payments from victim companies. With technology \nassuming an increasingly pervasive role in the retail sector, the stakes are high, and \nretailers must do everything they possibly can to protect the data they have, convince \ncustomers that their personal data is not vulnerable to misuse, and demonstrate that \ntheir practices are fully compliant with the latest regulations, such as the General Data \nProtection Regulation (GDPR). \n\nAmong the online security measures retailers are taking to protect themselves are \nstoring data off-site via the cloud; updating all software regularly, both in-store and \nonline; incorporating SD-WAN connections and unified threat management (UTM) \nappliances; and encrypting credit card readers. While point of sale (POS) software or \nwebsite plugins may serve as protection in specific segments of a brand\u2019s security \nsystem, retailers must take a proactive and comprehensive approach to anticipate and \nfrustrate ever-evolving cyber threats.\n\nhttps://www.gminsights.com/industry-analysis/smart-speaker-market?utm_source=globenewswire.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=Paid_Globnewswire\nhttps://www.criteo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/criteo-trade-marketing-whitepaper.pdf\nhttps://techcrunch.com/2015/02/25/target-says-credit-card-data-breach-cost-it-162m-in-2013-14/\nhttps://www.mytotalretail.com/article/macys-warns-of-data-breach/\nhttps://www.mytotalretail.com/article/is-security-a-priority-for-your-retail-stores/\n\n\nwhitepaper | A Year for Brilliant Connections 6\n\nBuilding robust cyber defenses today is impossible without AI. Tech consultancy IDC in its \nRetail Insights report estimates that by 2020, 75% of retailers will have adopted AI-based \ncyber-defense technologies. AI-powered security tools provide a time advantage. They also \nallow IT security professionals to shrink the surface for possible cyberattacks by gathering \ninsights and identifying connections and patterns between various types of threats\u2014\nincluding malicious files, suspicious IP addresses, and insider attacks. AI and machine \nlearning also strengthen traditional cyber defense tools, such as WAFs (web application \nfirewalls), allowing them to identify behavioral-based anomalies and fend off a broader \nrange of targeted attacks. \n\nIBM\u2019s 2018 Future of Identity Study reveals that customers now prioritize security over \nconvenience when logging into apps. Interestingly, the study showed that only 19% of US \nconsumers would trust a retail brand to protect their biometric data, as opposed to 57% \nwho trust financial institutions to guard the same data. Another major conclusion of the \nstudy was that young people are often careless with passwords and prefer biometric and \nmultifactor authentication instead. In fact, as many as 41% of millennials reuse log-in and \npassword information to access various sites. If even one site had a security breach, a \ncompromised password would give hackers access to multiple accounts. \n\nNew smart security tools now also address traditional non-tech threats retailers have \nalways faced. Among these is the theft of merchandise. According to the \u201cSay No to \nShoplifting\u201d campaign sponsored by the National Association for Shoplifting Prevention, \nretailers lose nearly $13 billion in stolen goods every year. In-store sensor security and \ntracking of theft is now possible due to the use of RFID technology, facial recognition \nsecurity cameras, GPS trackers in goods, and non-scan POS detection. \n\nConnect with technology to connect with customers \n\nIn a Harvard Business Review article on retailing, economists David S. Evans and Richard \nSchmalensee conclude that: \n\nIt is becoming increasingly clear that retail reinvention isn\u2019t a simple battle to the death between \nbricks and clicks. It is about devising retail models that work for people who are making \nincreasing use of a growing array of Internet-connected tools to change how they search, shop, \nand buy. Creative retailers are using the new technologies to innovate just about everything \nstores do from managing inventory, to marketing, to getting paid. \n\nIn this environment, so rich with experimentation, making brilliant connections with the \ncustomer is critical for success, as is using brilliant technology to enable those connections. \n\nSoftServe works closely with retailers online and in-store, equipping them with the \ntechnological platforms needed to best connect with customers\u2014and stay competitive. \n\nGet started, today.\n\nhttps://www.idc.com/getdoc.jsp?containerId=US43260317\nhttps://www-03.ibm.com/press/us/en/pressrelease/53646.wss\nhttp://www.shopliftingprevention.org/\nhttps://sensornation.com/blogs/news/the-hottest-retail-security-trends-of-2018\nhttps://sensornation.com/blogs/news/the-hottest-retail-security-trends-of-2018\nhttps://hbr.org/2016/05/the-best-retailers-combine-bricks-and-clicks?autocomplete=true\nhttps://softserveinc.com/en-us/contact/\n\n\nABOUT US\nSoftServe is a digital authority that advises and provides at the cutting-\nedge of technology.

Those who not able  \n\nto read the data and lag in its processing  \nwill fall far behind. It\u2019s time to face the fact \nthat the volume of insights that data  \nis able to provide is not manageable  \nby any individual\u2013a solo investor  \nor even a portfolio manager. \n\nBusiness Challenge\n\nPortfolio managers and individual investors \nplace particular focus on identifying areas \nof extra risk in investment portfolios.  \nThis is a challenging task and quite often \nhaving a deep understanding of business \nand profound experience are not enough. \n\nThe shock testing simulation technique \nis a core tool and critical element of risk \nmanagement not only in the banking \nindustry but also in investment portfolio \nmanagement.\n\n\n\ncase study |    Robust Portfolio Shock Testing Toolkit 2\n\nWith  the advances in data science  \nand artificial intelligence (AI), shock testing \nsoftware helps portfolio managers minimize \nrisk and increase return on investments. \n\nProject Description\n\nSoftServe\u2019s Financial Services Lab,  \nin partnership with its R&D department, \ndeveloped an application that predicts  \nthe impact of extreme but plausible market \nchanges on investment portfolios and enables \nportfolio managers to make adjustments  \nto achieve higher investment returns.  \n\nSoftServe's Robust Shock Testing Accelerator \nharnesses the power of data science  \nto simulate a portfolio\u2019s reaction to design \n\nshock scenarios of various market conditions. \nThe product analytics component provides \ninsights into portfolio performance at a given \ntime and also captures its dynamics. \n\nThe tool provides the following functionalities:\n\n\u2022 supports historical portfolio tracking\n\n\u2022 a range of shock scenarios\n\n\u2022 sensitivity analysis and portfolio result \nof each shock factor\n\n\u2022 recommendation for portfolio \noptimization for each predefined \nscenario\n\n\n\ncase study |    Robust Portfolio Shock Testing Toolkit 3\n\nThe Robust Shock Testing Accelerator  \nnot only answers the question \u201cwhat comes \nnext\u201d, but also provides direction regarding \nhow to act upon this information.\n\nSoftServe developed the Robust Shock \nTesting Accelerator based  \non the Capital Asset Pricing Model,  \nassessing the covariations between  \nbeta coefficients of portfolio stocks  \nand a selected stress factor.

The company developed a one of a kind platform for invoice trading based \non blockchain technology. Their mission is to connect people through finance sharing to \nprovide entrepreneurs with more funding choices and to satisfy investors with a higher \nreturn and the opportunity to make a real difference in someone\u2019s life.\n\nBusiness Challenge\n\nThe client\u2019s product was in the prototype stage when they partnered with SoftServe \nto undergo an initial coin offering (ICO). The client wanted to run the ICO to generate \nmore investments in the business, increase engagement with the platform, and provide \nmore liquidity for investors with future exchange operations. However, knowledgeable \nspecialists\u2014the demand greatly exceeds the supply\u2014 and development tools are lacking in \nICO implementations.\n\nWith no in-house technical or organizational experience, the client approached SoftServe \nfor help supporting its ICO initiative from the tech-consulting and development expertise \nstandpoint. One of the project\u2019s main challenges was that the client wanted investors \nholding both bitcoins and ethers to participate in the ICO. This requires support for bitcoin \nintegration with Ethereum to provide investors with greater liquidity and offer bitcoin \ninvestors more access to alternative finance investments previously traded in fiat currency.\n\n\n\ncase study |   Leading initial coin offering for asian fintech startup\u2014smart contracts 2\nand security assessment\n\nWith the industry is still so new, the infrastructure is not in place to work with smart \ncontracts. In fact, companies often work with raw material and tools with limited \nfunctionality. Also, a smart contract\u2014due to the nature of blockchain\u2014cannot be changed \nonce it has been released. Bugs in the code are tragic since there is no way to fix them \npost-release.\n\nThe client committed to provide investors with the highest security for the smart contracts \nso each was required to undergo extra security assessments, which were  conducted by \nSoftServe prior to launch.\n\nProject Description\n\nSoftServe\u2019s cooperation with the client included turnkey support for all planned ICO \nactivities as well as the following work stacks:\n\n\u2022 Initial strategic and technical consulting on business case and potential implementation \napproach \u2013 The initial input included a few high-level requirements to serve bitcoin \nholders as investors and run ICO in Ethereum. SoftServe conducted a series of \nworkshop sessions to define the main business rules, challenges, and project goals. \nBased on this information, the deal structure was refined and the tech approach was \nclarified. \n\n\u2022 Creating smart contracts for crowdsale \u2013 After defining the technical standpoint for \nthe ICO, the smart contracts were created. They were written to define the transaction \nrules with tokens. The release of tokens included a few stages\u2014a predefined time \nfor token purchase (initial offering), token to token exchange, and buying tokens with \nextra 'if' rules defined by the client that included special bonuses and discounts. The \nsmart contracts were written in Solidity language\u2014a dynamic programming language \nconstantly improved and developed according to the latest updates and findings in \nsmart contracts execution practice and discovered security issues. \n\n\u2022 Smart contracts security assessment \u2013 In addition to the smart contract development \nand careful assessment before release, SoftServe provided a solution that included \nseveral steps. SoftServe\u2019s security assessment service was used to validate the quality \nof the developed smart contracts. Due to the nature of the smart contract it cannot \nbe validated in the live environment\u2014no amendments or improvements can be made \nafter deployment. After initial local code review, the smart contracts were evaluated in \nthe testing environment to detect security holes and mitigate potential risks in the live \nenvironment. A few types of stress tests were also conducted using different simulation \ntechniques. The source code was provided to the client following the successful tests.  \n \nAn external third party was also used to validate the level of the smart contracts\u2019 \nsecurity before deploying code live. Again, the validation passed successfully and no \nissues were reported by the client.\n\n\n\ncase study |   Leading initial coin offering for asian fintech startup\u2014smart contracts 3\nand security assessment\n\n\u2022 Bitcoin wallets integration solution for Ethereum \u2013 The main business requirement\u2014as \ndefined by the client\u2014was to provide investors that hold private wallets in bitcoins with \na smooth investing transaction experience. Since Ethereum operates with ethers and \nsmart contracts but does not support transactions in bitcoins, a smart approach to \nensure convenience for bitcoin holders had to be created. \n \nThe SoftServe team defined the process for the integration and a private cabinet was \ncreated for each investor that registered to take part in purchasing the tokens.  \n \nEach investor was asked to use ether wallet for funding transactions or was provided \nwith a link to a personal bitcoin wallet created by the system\u2014this was for investors \nthat did not have an ether wallet but wanted to invest owned bitcoins to purchase \ntokens. The investor could send bitcoins from their personal wallet to the newly created \nsystem wallet. \n \nAfter checking balances of the system created bitcoin wallets, the system transferred \ninvested bitcoins to one central wallet at the admin\u2019s request. Investors\u2019 ether wallets \nwere granted a defined number of tokens. The system web jobs processed requests \nto ensure all ether investors and investors with bitcoin wallets received their tokens \nproperly.\n\nTechnology Stack\n\n\u2022 Ethereum as a platform to run smart \ncontracts \n\n\u2022 Solidity for smart contract \nimplementation \n\n\u2022 Truffle for compiling and deploying test \nsmart contract \n\n\u2022 Azure for building, deploying, and \nmanaging application for ICO\n\n\u2022 NBitcoin as a bitcoin library for the .NET \nplatform \n\n\u2022 Get - golfing implementation of \nEthereum protocol, Ethereum client \n\n\u2022 Rinkeby used as a test network for \nEthereum\n\nValue Delivered\n\nSoftServe\u2019s cooperation with the client was successful.

Digital readers \nhave overtaken print ones across News \nUK\u2019s brands: The Times and The Sunday \nTimes have more than 380,000 digital-only \nsubscribers.

To stay on top, \nwe have to foster a loyal relationship \nwith our readers, providing them with \ngreat content, while maximizing ad \nrevenue from targeted advertising.\u201d\n\nT o balance both these goals, News UK\u2019s \nbusiness teams must make increasingly \n\ndata-driven decisions. \"We\u2019re committed to \nproviding our digital readers with the best \npossible content and services, especially for \nour subscription-based services,\" explains \nKarthik. \"Accessible data insights are crucial \nto enable the newsroom to curate more \nrelevant content for our audiences, while \nincreasing our ad revenue and supporting \nour sales and marketing teams.\"\n\n\"We want to create a \nsustainable, cost-effective \ncloud strategy that will provide \nflexibility to support business \ndecisions over the next five \nyears, so we're looking at \nsolutions that can grow with \nus.

But when \nKarthik joined News UK in June 2018, \nconnecting the dots between News UK's \nfirst-party customer datasets and the data \ngenerated from customer interactions \non its websites and apps was a challenge. \nWith two data warehouses on two \nseparate cloud platforms, the marketing, \nanalytics, data science, subscription, and \ncustomer services teams couldn't easily \ngain insights due to information silos.\n\nBecause behavioral data was stored \nseparately from data relating to \n\ndemographics and subscriptions, end \nusers had to manually combine these \ndatasets in marketing and analytics tools \nto deliver insights to the business teams. \nWith duplicate workflows required for \nevery single use case, drawing insights \nfrom data was a time-consuming process.\n\n\"Having two parallel data warehouses made \nthings harder for business teams that needed a \nholistic view of our data assets,\u201d says Karthik. \n\n\u201cIt wasn't cost-effective, as the only way to \nfully integrate them was to transfer data \nbetween the warehouses or within external \ntools such as tableau. That required extra \nengineering work and transfer costs.\u201d\n\nReducing maintenance, improving access across teams\n\nW hat Karthik and his team needed was \na single source for both batch and \n\nreal-time data, to provide deeper insights \ninto News UK\u2019s customer behavior with \nlower maintenance efforts. When the \nrollout of GDPR required an audit of News \nUK\u2019s data compliance strategies, the team \nused it as an opportunity to also rethink \nthe company\u2019s overall approach to data.\n\n\"We wanted a scalable solution \nfor data storage and access, \nand based on our previous \nexperience, BigQuery was the \nideal choice. The serverless \naspect is a huge win, enabling \nus to focus on adding value \nto the business, not worrying \nabout our data warehouse\u2019s \nbackend scalability.\"\n\n\u2014Karthik Ramani, \n    Head of Data Platforms, News UK\n\ncase study News UK: Helping business teams read between the lines with a 360\u00b0 view of reader data 4\n\n\n\nNews UK had already been using \nBigQuery for its data science use \n\ncases for five years, so the digital datasets \nfor customer interactions were already on \nGoogle Cloud. With firsthand knowledge \nof the scalability and performance of \nGoogle Cloud, the team decided to \nexpand its footprint, streamlining its data \nwarehousing with a single, flexible solution.\n\n\"We want to create a sustainable, cost-effective \ncloud strategy that will provide flexibility \nto support business decisions over the next \nfive years, so we're looking at solutions \nthat can grow with us. That\u2019s what we\u2019ve \nfound in Google Cloud and its BigQuery \ndata warehouse,\" says Karthik.\n\nK arthik was confident that BigQuery \ncould handle the growing number \n\nand complexity of stream, batch, and \nAPI-based datasets that News UK ingested, \nin addition to easily accommodating future \ngrowth. \"We wanted a scalable solution for \ndata storage and access, and based on our \nprevious experience, BigQuery was the ideal \nchoice,\u201d says Karthik. \u201cThe serverless aspect \nis a huge win, enabling us to focus on adding \nvalue to the business, not worrying about \nour data warehouse\u2019s backend scalability.\"\n\nK arthik\u2019s goal was to empower his data \nanalysts looking to analyze data for \n\nreal-time insights and easily run ML models \nand achieve AI initiatives, without the need \nfor additional features or tools. His data \nanalysts also wanted to be able to focus \non running cutting-edge analytics instead \nof worrying about operational overheads. \n\nSelecting BigQuery for a solution that\u2019s growth-ready\n\nNews UK\u2019s previous data warehouse was \nunequipped to produce these analytics, and it \nfaced performance challenges that inhibited \nagile decision-making. With BigQuery, \nKarthik recognized the opportunity to unlock \nfaster business value while running on fully \nmanaged infrastructure and lowering costs.\n\nT o make sure its customer data was \ncompletely secure, News UK conducted \n\nan evaluation before transferring it to \nBigQuery. \"During the process, we found \nthat the security we needed in terms of access \ncontrols was built in, and that was reassuring,\" \nsays Karthik. \"We didn't need to invest in \nbuilding additional internal security layers. We \ncould control access at table and column level, \nand use BigQuery Data Access Audit logs.\"\n\n\u201cEveryone is more confident \nin providing business teams \nwith new capabilities. It used \nto take a couple of months of \nplanning to scale up and add \nnew nodes to our Redshift data \nwarehouse.

This \nsaved us a lot of time that we would have \nspent looking for the answers ourselves.\u201d\n\nWorking with Google Cloud Consulting for a smooth migration\n\nT he whole project took about 15 months, \nend-to-end. News UK now uses Cloud \n\nComposer as its workflow orchestration \nservice, alongside Cloud Storage and \nBigQuery for its batch processing, with \nDataflow and Pub/Sub for its real-time data \npipeline.

The company is focused on energizing human potential \nwhile seeking new and better ways to responsibly produce energy \nto sustain our world. \n\nDigital transformation is a strategy that Vital Energy actively \nembraces. SoftServe is a key engineering and consulting partner \n\nto Vital Energy and has helped them leverage data and develop AI \nalgorithms to boost their digital effectiveness. \n\nVital Energy's business relies heavily on artificial lift systems. \nSelecting the correct operating parameters for the lift systems \nis a significant challenge, and getting it right is essential for \nmaintaining a safe working environment while maximizing well \nproductivity. Fortunately, intelligent technologies such as artificial \nintelligence (AI), machine learning (ML), the internet of things \n(IoT), and data science have simplified monitoring, analysis, and \noptimization tasks. These intelligent tools enable operators  \nto identify potential problems and recommend optimal operation \nparameters, leading to increased oil and gas production.\n\nhttps://vitalenergy.com/\n\n\nCase Study   |   Vital Energy and SoftServe Join Forces to Optimize Gas Lift Systems and Boost Production Rates 3\n\nBUSINESS CHALLENGE\nGas lift systems are commonly used in the oil and \ngas industry to lift fluids from wells to the surface. \nWhile gas lift systems can be effective and have \nmany advantages, there are challenges that can \naffect their performance and reliability. These \nchallenges typically center around operational \nregimes and reservoir parameters such as:\n\nOther challenges are more about equipment \nreliability, well integrity, and mistakes in initial  \nwell design: \n\nHole in the tubing is a common problem for wells \nboth free-flowing and on artificial lifts. For gas lift-\noperated wells this is particularly pricy due to high \nlosses in production and downtime needed to \ndeal with the problem. Some of those \u201choles\u201d are \noften caused by corrosion and erosion processes, \nsome by leaky injection valves or tubing joints. \n\nReservoir\n\nProduced fluids\n\nGas-Lift Gas\n\nOperating valve\n\nGas Lift Valve\n\nGas Annulus\n\nTubing\n\nFaced with these challenges, Vital Energy wanted \nto create data- and knowledge-driven solutions  \nto help with gas lift system optimization, \nmonitoring, and troubleshooting. \n\nVital Energy selected SoftServe as their project \npartner due, in part, to our extensive expertise  \nin the energy domain, particularly in \nimplementing various types of solutions \nfor artificial lift systems. In addition, our \nexpertise extends to big data, data science, ML \ntechnologies, and AWS services.\n\nFinding the optimal injection rate can be \nchallenging due to factors such as wellbore \ngeometry, fluid properties, and reservoir \nconditions. If the injection rate is too high, it \ncan lead to gas channeling, which reduces the \neffectiveness of the system. If the injection rate \nis too low, it can lead to insufficient gas lift, which \nreduces production. \n\nMaintaining consistent injection pressure. \nEnsuring that the injection pressure of gas \nremains stable is crucial to effectively operating \ngas lift systems. Key challenges are around \nfluctuations in reservoir pressure, alterations \nin wellbore geometry, and changes in fluid \ncomposition during production. Often a sign  \nof insufficient injection pressure is gas  \nslippage \u2014 when gas escapes around the outside \nof the tubing instead of lifting the fluids  \nto the surface.\n\n\n\nCase Study   |   Vital Energy and SoftServe Join Forces to Optimize Gas Lift Systems and Boost Production Rates 4\n\nTHE APPROACH\nTo better understand the client's business needs and requirements, \nthe SoftServe team initiated the discovery phase and conducted \nworkshops. Following this, we provided proof of concept (PoC) to \ndemonstrate the solution's feasibility, and the team will now work \non developing the full-scale software solution.\n\nSoftServe paid special attention to Vital Energy\u2019s needs and \nrequirements. The team adopted an agile approach and quickly \nadapted to changing circumstances as they arose. Our experts \nproposed various enhancements that helped Vital Energy improve \nits processes.\n\nHere\u2019s what the PoC solution for the gas lift optimization project \ndelivered: \n\nAn anomaly detection algorithm \nthat is pointed for early signs of \na hole in the tubing and scale \nbuilt-up was developed.\n\nDashboards with operational \nvalues and calculated \nparameters, visualization, \nanomalies, alerting, and \nequipment grouping were \ncreated and deployed.\n\nThis is not the first project SoftServe \nhas done for Vital Energy.

Although the system \nmodules are decoupled and provide a \nrobust solution, there were improvements \nthat could be made to the architecture and \nCI/CD environment to enhance availability \nand scalability approaches based on AWS \nservices.\n\nDue to increases in customer usage, driving \nnew business requirements and in order \nto improve current infrastructure in the \ncost-efficient way, it was decided to start \ndevelopment of serverless application \n\nwithin the Proof of Concept stage for \nfurther migration to the production-ready \nsolution.

Since client requirement was to use \nBitBucket service as a git repository, we integrated it with AWS CodeCommit for having \nfull-featured CI/CD Pipeline. We have git mono-repository, each lambda function has it is \nown directory for the codebase. Once changes on CodeCommit trigger AWS CodeBuild, it \nassembles the application, sends code to S3 bucket and moves CloudFormation template \nfile up the pipeline chain to deploy the changed resources. In order to deploy only that \nlambda function which code was changed, we set up Maven reproducible builds plugin. \n\n\n\ncase study |    AWS Serverless Application Model Improves Cost Efficiency for Precision Exam\u2019s Infrastructure 4\n\nAccordingly, to the decision of using serverless services as much as possible, we migrated \nstatic web content from reserved EC2 instances to AWS S3 buckets with enabled Static \nWeb Hosting option, CloudFront, Route53. All of the static web content, including HTML, \nCSS, JavaScript, images and other files are securely served via Amazon CloudFront. End \nusers access the website using the public website URL exposed by Amazon Route 53, which \npoints to Amazon CloudFront distribution.

It provides the ability to test the code internally and \ndoes not upload the code into AWS each time in order to test the changes. Mostly, we use \nSAM CLI for API Gateway emulation and local function invocation. In its essence, SAM is a \nCloudFormation library, therefore we have serverless resources (Lambdas, API gateways) \ndescribed as a code.

They asked SoftServe\u2019s help \nto create a plan and implement cloud DR for \nthree of its products. Our client\u2019s existing \ninfrastructure was well documented and \nvery complicated, including many manual \nprocesses. Additional challenges appeared \nas SoftServe engaged our client in discovery \nconversations. For example, one key challenge \nwas enabling public peering as the client\u2019s \nproducts only support private peering. Also, \nits SQL environment needed to be upgraded \nto support \u201cAlways On\u201d, a way to deliver High \nAvailability (HA) in SQL Server.\n\nSoftServe proposed a fully automated solution \nto reduce costs and potential errors in opera-\ntions. Upon reviewing SoftServe\u2019s proposal, \nour client chose to update their infra-\nstructure with advanced DR practices such \nas Infrastructure as Code (IaC) and SQL \nAlways On. SoftServe built its strategy in \na way that would migrate three different \ndatacenters to the cloud.\n\nProject Description\n\nT he project was divided into several \nphases, each of which handled separate \nsteps of the DR plan. The first phase, \n\nDisaster Recovery project planning, covered \ninfrastructure changes and the establishment \nof a backup procedure. Using Infrastructure \nas Code all the information that described \nthe infrastructure environment and configu-\nration was stored as files, enabling a smooth \nand quick migration to the cloud.\n\nThe Disaster Recovery architecture solution \nensured data resilience and several ways to \nreplicate data. It also supports the ability to \nautomate failover and failback using produc-\ntion-ready and application-specific scripts \ndeveloped by SoftServe.\n\ncase study |    SoftServe Implements a Long-Term Azure \n      Disaster Recovery Plan For Datacenters\n\n2\n\n\n\nUsers Traffic Manager\n(DNS Routing)\n\nExpressRoute\nGateway\n\nExpress\nRoute\nCircuit\n\nWindows Server\nFailover Cluster\n\nDatabase segment\n\nWeb/App\nsegmentWindows Server\n\nFailover Cluster\nWeb/App\nsegment\n\nAzure\nStorage\n\nAutomatic Account\nwith runbooks\n\nBackup and\nSite Recovery\n\nKey\nVisual\n\nOMS Workplace\n\nOn-Premise\n\nAzure\n\nAzure Failover Site\n\nAfter FailoverBefore Failover\n\nSetting up the backup procedure was one of \nthe main challenges for SoftServe. Because our \nclient\u2019s infrastructure only supported private \npeering, there was no way SoftServe could use it \nto establish external backups without purchasing \nnew equipment for public peering support. \n\nSoftServe addressed this problem with Private \nLink. PrivateLink provides private endpoints for \nAzure Playtform as a Service (PaaS) services \nlike blobs, Azure SQL, etc. With PrivateLink \nthe endpoints could be accessed through \nExpressRoute private peering, eliminating the \nuse of public peering (and new hardware).\n\nThe second phase, Preparation of the Cloud \nSite, was mainly centered around SQL Always \nOn. When Always On is successfully imple-\nmented, it provides a low RPO (recovery \npoint objective) and RTO (recovery time \nobjective) in case of disaster. \n\ncase study |    SoftServe Implements a Long-Term Azure \n      Disaster Recovery Plan For Datacenters\n\n3\n\nDisaster Recovery architecture solution\n\n\n\nValue Delivered\n\nS oftServe delivered to the client a fully \nimplemented Disaster Recovery solu-\ntion. It ensures that our client\u2019s data-\n\ncenters can quickly resume mission-critical \nfunctions following a disaster. \n\nThe use of Infrastructure as Code SoftServe \nprovided greater flexibility, less downtime \nand greater overall cost efficiency. Because the \ninfrastructure environment and configuration \nare stored as files, the same code may be \nreused to build new environments in future. \n\nIn the event of a disaster, our client\u2019s DR \nsolution will minimize data loss and system \ndowntime. The implementation of SQL Always \nOn will provide a low RTO and RPO, limiting \nthe data loss to minutes.\n\ncase study |    SoftServe Implements a Long-Term Azure \n      Disaster Recovery Plan For Datacenters\n\n4\n\n\n\nABOUT US\nSoftServe is a digital authority that advises and provides at the \ncutting-edge of technology.

For the last few years its adoption has moved \nsignificantly from visionaries to pragmatists, so today it\u2019s difficult to find any enterprise \norganization that isn\u2019t investing in storing, processing, and extracting value from their \nmountain of growing data.\n\nHowever, once companies have become capable of collecting and processing massive data, \nthe question then becomes: \u201cHow can I get the maximum value out of it?\u201d\n\nEvery company is at a different point in its big data journey, so maximizing its business value \nmeans moving big data adoption to the next stage. Although there is not a single standard \nor metric to measure an organization\u2019s current state, the concept of \u201cmaturity models\u201d is a \nsimplified but efficient way to assess something\u2019s potential relative to other organizations.\n\n2whitepaper | Make Big Data Work with Machine Learning\n\n\n\n3whitepaper | Make Big Data Work with Machine Learning\n\nBig Data Analytics Maturity Model\nThe graphic below illustrates the Big Data Analytics Maturity Model, which characterizes the \npath of an organization from its beginning stage, \u201cData,\u201d to \u201cWisdom,\u201d which serves as both a \npinnacle and a limitless destination in terms of its business possibilities.\n\nFigure: Big Data Analytics Maturity Model\n\nThe pyramid itself is an adaptation of the DIKW (data\u2013information\u2013knowledge\u2013wisdom) \nhierarchy, which is one of the fundamental and widely recognized concepts regarding \nthe data value chain. We use this model since it is easy to understand and its graphical \nillustration speaks for itself.\n\nCognitive analytics and automated decision making\n\nReal-time analytics and decision making\nData streaming\n\nPaperless but heavy manual data processing\nData warehouse, ETL, Excel reports\n\nSelf-service analytics\nDashboard, Online reports\n\nUncovered value from unstructured data\nData lake, Data pipeline\n\nWisdom\n\nSpeed\n\nInsight\n\nInformation\n\nData\n\n\n\n4whitepaper | Make Big Data Work with Machine Learning\n\nNow, let\u2019s connect the pyramid levels to the business needs of a modern enterprise:\n\nData\nWhat does it mean if an organization is at the Data level? Usually it means the organization \nhas paperless but heavy manual processes and a wide variety of data, from documents and \ntransactional records to media files, machine generated logs, and sensor data. Data might \nhave been collecting for decades from different sources and stored in a data warehouse or a \nraw format, but the analysis of that data is underdeveloped.\n\nIn this case, the organization\u2019s teams dedicate a great deal of resources to extracting factual \ninformation in a non-automated fashion, typically to build reports in Microsoft Excel or \nAdobe PDF files.\n\nIt\u2019s obvious but worth stating: being on this level means an organization\u2019s data processes \u2013 or \nlack thereof \u2013 are holding it back from unlocking its potential, both in operational efficiency \nand in its ability to innovate new products or services.\n\nInformation\nWhen data is being collected, it should be processed to be useful and answer who, what, \nwhere and when questions. This is a descriptive state of information, which is often \ncharacterized in the form of online reports, dashboards, and self-service capabilities that \nretrieve information of interest without requesting the support of IT or other departments.\n\nFrom a technology perspective, typically this means an organization has a \u201cbusiness \nintelligence (BI) platform\u201d that provides access to corporate data. Although this is a significant \nstep in maturity from the data stage, and many organizations can be found at this level, a set \nof questions still remain unanswered for business users \u2013 how, why, and what if?\n\nInsight\nThis level is more complex to explain than the data and information levels of the maturity \nmodel, as it moves closer to a manifestation of the human mind. For the sake of conciseness, \nwe will define it as taking advantage of actionable information that conveys understanding, \naccumulated learning, and expertise. In other words, this level increases an individual\u2019s \ncapacity to take effective action. Technologically speaking, it includes the synthesis of \nmultiple sources of information and the ability to uncover hidden patterns and correlations.\n\nConsider the example of a doctor who makes the right diagnosis based on comprehensive \npatient information, including test results, patient interviews, and the patient\u2019s medical \nhistory. He can then select the most effective treatment plan supported by his or her \nknowledge of industry studies and professional experience.\n\n\n\n5whitepaper | Make Big Data Work with Machine Learning\n\nThere are several elements in an enterprise architecture landscape that enable actionable \ndecision-making at this level, including a data lake that collects a wide variety of data from \nstructured, semi-structured, and unstructured data sources and a data processing pipeline \nthat transforms that raw data into ready-to-consume holistic representations.\n\nOrganizations that have achieved this level of data maturity typically boast significant \nimprovements to operational efficiency and/or increased revenue from products or services.\n\nWhat could be better? An acceleration of decision-making, which is the next level.\n\nSpeed\nThis level refers to an organization\u2019s speed of decision-making. Supported by a solid \nfoundation of insight (or actionable information), this level generates numerous possibilities \nby making real-time or near-realtime access to information a competitive advantage. \nData streaming, mobile computing, and IoT (Internet of Things) technologies make these \nadvantages possible from a technology perspective.\n\nGreater speed can lead to increased productivity and additional revenue sources from new \nproducts or services. It can also support the optimization of processes that can dynamically \nadopt themselves to environments that are constantly changing, due to factors like market \nconditions or even the weather.\n\nToday, there are not many companies that can claim a solid footing at this stage or that they \nare reaping all of the benefits from this level, though many industry visionaries are investing \nheavily to get there. In fact, many might still consider the \u201cspeed\u201d level the ultimate goal, not \nrealizing what is possible when a company moves beyond speed to what we call \u201cwisdom.\u201d\n\nWisdom\nSome may argue that this is a rather elusive concept and has more to do with human \nintuition, understanding, interpretation, and actions than it does with enterprise systems or \ntechnology.\n\nIn our definition, wisdom is the highest level of the data value chain; the state where digital \nsolutions can achieve par-human or even superhuman performance when solving difficult \ntasks intractable for traditional computing techniques. These tasks often imply complex \nsituations that are characterized by ambiguity, uncertainty, and conflicting evidence.\n\nThis is exactly the goal of cognitive computing, which in its turn is based on machine \nlearning techniques that mimic the way the human brain works. One of the latest \ntechniques, deep learning, accomplished more in just three years than what has been done \nwithin the preceding 25 years in the field of AI (artificial intelligence).\n\n\n\n6whitepaper | Make Big Data Work with Machine Learning\n\nFigure: Simplified example of an enterprise big data architecture at the Wisdom level\n\nIt is worth mentioning that not all company departments can be at the same level of big \ndata adoption maturity. In fact, it\u2019s rather an exception across an industry. But what is most \ncommon among departments is that they can elevate their maturity level and get more value \nfrom data with machine learning in spite of a corporate function.\n\nU\nse\n\nrs\n (H\n\num\nan\n\ns \nan\n\nd \nM\n\nac\nhi\n\nne\ns)\n\nIn\nte\n\nlli\nge\n\nnt\n E\n\nnt\ner\n\npr\nis\n\ne\n\nIntelligence\n\nAugmented \nIntelligence\n\nEnterprise Data \nWarehouse\n\nDW Hot Data\nStreaming\n\nStructured\nData\n\nSemi and \nUnstructured Data\n\nIntelligent\nAutomation\n\nData\nLake\n\n\n\n7whitepaper | Make Big Data Work with Machine Learning\n\nMachine Learning Business Use-Cases\nWhat is most important for any business is staying competitive and not falling victim to \ndisruption or displacement. That being said, it is crucial to look at big data, and machine \nlearning in particular, not as a technology challenge to be solved by an organization\u2019s IT \ndepartment, but as a business leadership opportunity. Meaning that the business strategy \nshould incorporate machine learning to get maximum value out of data and to use it as a \npowerful vehicle of digital transformation.\n\nMany organizations have difficulties at this stage selecting business use-cases that will \nbring the most business value and start technology implementations. Indeed, the variety of \npossibilities and potential use-cases of machine learning is overwhelming; there is no such \ndistinctness in its adoption as in the adoption of mobile or cloud technologies. That\u2019s why we \noften hear questions: \u201cWhat can big data and machine learning do for our business? What \nare examples of successful business use-cases in our industry?\u201d\n\nAlthough every business is unique in many respects, most business usecases can be derived \nfrom the universal monetary drivers, such as business growth and business operations:\n\nBusiness growth\n \u2022 New revenue creation (G1)\n \u2022 Existing revenue increase (G2)\n\nBusiness operations\n \u2022 Productivity

organizations, there are \nmuch more specific use-cases which can become organizations\u2019 unique differentiatiors. In \nthe next section, we will illuminate how to select significant business use-cases and achieve \nresults in a predictable manner, in spite of the associated technological challenges.\n\nMachine Learning Projects Best Practices\nOver almost 30 years, machine learning has been developing techniques and algorithms, \ngradually increasing its accuracy. For many years, performance of the majority of AI \napplications remained sub-human, i.e. worse than average human performance. But since \n2012 the situation has started to change, and the changes are quite drastic in terms of \ntechnology breakthrough and market demand for skilled professionals in this discipline.\n\nTypical questions that business leaders are seeking answers to are: How can we pick proper \nbusiness use-cases? How do we initiate the project? Are there any methods and processes \nthat can help us achieve results in a predictive manner? We will address these questions in \nthis paper by describing the three key best practices \u2013 Ideation Workshop, Multidisciplinary \nTeam, and Rapid Prototyping.\n\nIdeation Workshop\nThis is the first important exercise to prioritize business use-cases through ideation of \npotential business opportunities. The ideation workshop includes both business and \ntechnology stakeholders along with big data and machine learning experts to generate the \nuse-cases and to estimate their preliminary business value and ease of implementation. The \nprioritization method shown below is based on the best combination of these two factors \nand serves as a roadmap for further execution.\n\n\n\n11whitepaper | Make Big Data Work with Machine Learning\n\nFigure: Sample of prioritized business use-cases\n\nMultidisciplinary Team\nWhen business use-cases are defined, the project scope and complexity often require the \ninvolvement of a team of professionals with different skillset. It would be a fallacy to wait for \nthe super-hero data scientist to come along. Modern business and technology challenges, in \norder to be solved successfully, require tight cooperation of multiple disciplines.\n\nData science, big data engineering, experience design, and subject matter expertise are \ncompetencies that form a project core team. Design thinking, and in particular the design \nsprint process, help set up an interdisciplinary collaboration and align the team towards a \ncommon target.\n\nBusiness\nValue\n\nHi\n\nLow\n\nLow Hi\n\nEase of Implementation\n\n5 3\n\nMust Haves\n\n1\n\nQuick Wins\n\nMoney Pits\n\n2 4\n\nLow-Hanging Fruit\n\n\n\n12whitepaper | Make Big Data Work with Machine Learning\n\nRapid Prototyping\nAlmost every machine learning project is more research-driven than most software \nengineering projects developed with traditional computation techniques. Business use-cases \nare based on hypotheses rather than facts, so they must be validated through experiments \nand tests to make them real. In Data Science, such experiments are performed with help of \nthrowaway prototypes, also known as proofs of concept (PoC) using highly iterative and agile \ncycles.\n\nFor this purpose, data scientists use a set of tools, which noticeably reduce a PoC cycle \nto a few weeks or even days. Once the hypothesis is tested and the model\u2019s accuracy \nis satisfactory, the research phase can be considered as done and use-case validation \ncomplete.\n\nFigure: Machine learning project research phase process\n\nIn the meantime, the big data engineering team works on connecting data sources, a data \nprocessing pipeline, and other possible ingredients of a big data solution to be ready for \ndeployment of the machine learning model in production. The Strategic Prototyping \nmethod can be helpful in bringing predictability into big data/machine learning projects and \nin avoiding cost, schedule and quality risks.\n\nEvaluation\n\nResearch Phase\n\n \u2022 Interviewing business \nand technical \nstakeholders\n\n \u2022 Requirements collection\n\n \u2022 Domain research\n\nBusiness\nUnderstanding\n\n \u2022 Data assessment\n\n \u2022 Data sourse selection\n\n \u2022 Data integration\n\n \u2022 Data cleansing\n\nData\nCollection\n\n \u2022 Data understanding\n\n \u2022 Data transformation \nand aggregation\n\n \u2022 Data analysis\n\nData\nExploration\n\n \u2022 Machine learning\n\n \u2022 Hypothesis testing\n\n \u2022 Rapid prototyping \n(PoC)\n\nData\nModelling\n\n\n\n13whitepaper | Make Big Data Work with Machine Learning\n\nSummary\nIn this paper we provided answers to a number of frequent and important questions for \nany business that seeks to incorporate big data and machine learning into a business digital \ntransformation strategy, including:\n\n \u2022 How to get the maximum value out of data\n \u2022 What big data and machine learning can do for our business\n \u2022 How to pick the most promising business use-cases\n \u2022 How to start your project\n\nOnce business leadership is ready for creative and breakthrough projects, anything \nis possible; even the most radical ideas get implementation with latest bleeding edge \ntechnologies.

The core engine is a resource \norchestrator written in Golang, that provides \nmulti-cloud strategy to provision all the re-\nsources necessary for product deployment. \nGoogle Cloud Platform (GCP) was chosen as a \nfirst implementation strategy, with Azure and \nOpenStack (on-prem) planned for further de-\nvelopment. Under the hood, the core engine is \ngenerally an API service which does Terraform \ninfra provisioning and deploy services via K8s \nparameterized manifests. For each product, \nthe core engine creates a GCP project with \nGKE cluster, SVPC subnet, CloudSQL, GCS, \nDatastore, etc. The platform itself consists \nof 4 components (verticals) implementing \nUI (Explore and Register), Monitoring/Logs \n(Observe), Costs (Control) and CICD pipeline \n(Deliver), each communicating with the core \nengine.\n\nSoftServe was tasked with performing a se-\ncurity assessment and risk mitigation prior \nto the release of the platform. Additionally \nwith the creation of security architecture and \nimplementation of technical security controls, \nSoftServe created a custom framework for \nsecure development, operations, and support \nof the client\u2019s solution.\n\nSoftServe overcame the following challenges \nduring this project.\n\n\u2022 DC Ops requirement was that only a \nfully-private VPC could be connected \nto on-prem networks via a VPN, and all \negress traffic should flow through an \non-prem HTTP proxy\n\n\u2022 The GCP implementation of SVPC had \nsome limitations on the amount of VPC \npeering, requiring exposure of external \nIPs for services and k8s masters\n\n\u2022 Some GCP services usage was also \nrestricted/limited in a fully-private VPC, \nlike CloudBuild\n\n\u2022 Strict security policies had to be re-\nengineered and adapted for public \ncloud environments while maintaining \ncompatibility with private data center \nsecurity rules\n\ncase study |    Security Assessment and Architecture Implementation on GCP Ensures Secure \nProduct Deployments for Multinational Retail Giant\n\n3\n\n\n\nValue Delivered\n\nS oftServe designed a full set of security \ntechnical controls along with recom-\nmended toolsets and related process-\n\nes covering not just the cloud infrastructure \nitself, but also related SLDC, CI/CD, and op-\nerational/support activities. This resulted in \na unique Information Security Management \nSystem (ISMS) framework that is fully aligned \nwith national and international industry stan-\ndards and is capable of maintaining our client\u2019s \nstrong security posture for hybrid computing \nenvironments (on-prem and cloud).\n\nThe delivered set of security controls also \nserves as security guidelines that allows for \nfuture development of secure services and \napplications.\n\nFrom a technical standpoint, SoftServe utilized \nnative GCP security mechanisms as often as \npossible to provide maximum scalability for \nservices and follow CSPs best practices.\n\nSoftServe delivered robust security standards \nto ensure our client\u2019s new \u2018layer\u2019 is protected \naccording to industry standards.

Our client \ndeeply understands the needs of financial \nservice customers, with nearly 8,000 \noffices across North and South America, \nSpain, and Turkey that manage\u00a0around \nthree-quarters of a trillion euros in \ncapital.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nBut in order to meet their goal of\u00a0growing \ntheir equities division from around\u00a0\u20ac100M \n($117M) to a multibillion-euro\u00a0business, \nour client knew they needed a digital \nauthority as a partner.\u00a0\n\nAt the time, the client used an internal \ndata center to host their legacy equities \nbusiness platform. This\u2014along with \nthe platform\u2019s manual calibration of \ncustomers\u2019 equities assets\u2014limited \nscalability. This lengthy calibration \nprocess meant traders often failed to \ndeliver accurate information within the \nlimited response window, leading to a \ncustomer request rejection rate of more \nthan 50%.\n\nBuild for your unique business systems \nwith a microservices approach to \nimprove reliability and stability and \naccelerate growth. \n\nIt was then the client approached \nSoftServe for help transforming and \nimproving their equities services. They \nwanted to develop a better, cloud-based \nsolution using a microservice approach \nto design and build a new application \ninfrastructure from scratch. \n\nSoftServe\u2019s experts understood that the \nbest course of action was moving the \nclient\u2019s internal data center to the cloud. \nOur team knew that we could improve \nelasticity and scalability by decoupling \nindividual solution components using \nAWS Managed Services.  In addition, \nproviding a microservice solution where \neach piece could be changed individually \nwould most effectively utilize AWS\u2019 Cloud-\nprovided services. \n\nOur client saw this migration project and \nmoving calibration products as a test. If \nsuccessful, the client planned to migrate \nmany more elements of their financial \nservice offerings. \n\nSince this was the client\u2019s first time for \ncloud migration, the SoftServe team \nneeded first to establish best practices \nwithin the client\u2019s organization so the \nnew cloud services could perform at their \npeak. The next step was to build a highly \navailable, scalable, cost-effective, and \nrobust system that fully complied with \nthe client\u2019s internal security policies.\n\ncase study |    AWS Cloud Modernization Use Case 2\n\n\n\nT o start, SoftServe introduced Amazon \nElastic Kubernetes Service (EKS) as \nthe computing layer for the equities \n\ncalibration engine. Our experts knew it \nwas crucial to add Amazon Aurora as a \nstorage layer for the equities market data \nbased on best practices and application \nrequirements. After that, our team \nimplemented Amazon Managed Streaming \nfor Apache Kafka (MSK) to ensure these \ndistributed microservices communicated \ncorrectly. \n\nUsing this microservice architecture, the \nSoftServe team configured Amazon EKS to \nrun specific workloads on the appropriate \nnode group. That allowed the team to select \nthe most effective type of EC2 instance for \n\neach configuration. In turn, this enabled \ncustom scaleup or down policies based on \na particular component\u2019s metrics. If the \nworkloads could run on RISC processors, \nthe experts then used the Graviton instance \nfamily for those nodes inside the same EKS \ncluster.  \n\nThe ability to customize these elements \nimproved the system\u2019s overall performance \nwhile reducing our client\u2019s cloud \nexpenditures. When combined with re-\narchitecting the infrastructure, these \nefforts cut the equities asset data-to-\nanalysis time from up to 20 minutes to \na mere 10 \u2013 30 seconds. It also added \nscalability and simplified the update \nprocess. \n\ncase study |    AWS Cloud Modernization Use Case 3\n\nFigure 1: Infrastructure architecture \n\n\n\nT he SoftServe team used the \nGitFlow approach for application \ndevelopment, which meant \n\nimplementing ephemeral environments \non a dev cluster in separate Kubernetes \nnamespaces to test units and integration. \nThis flow creates ephemeral environments \nwhen a pull request is opened and destroys \nthem after successful testing. Our experts \nsought to apply the changes to the dev \nenvironment for further review if testing \nproved successful. After that point, they \ncould destroy the ephemeral environments.  \n\nBy designing and building these CI/ CD \npipelines this way, the SoftServe team \ncould make frequent microservice \napplication releases, reducing new feature \ntime-to-market and improving the release \nmanagement process.\n\nThe simplified architecture of CI/CD pipeline developed for services:\n\ncase study |    AWS Cloud Modernization Use Case 4\n\nFigure 2: CI/CD pipeline\n\n\n\nF inally, in order to monitor all the \nservices deployed in EKS, our \nSoftServe experts configured \n\nFluentBit DaemonSet with FluentD running \non separate nodes for advanced parsing. \nExecuted on each node, FluentBit is a \nlightweight process that forwards all logs \nto FluentD. FluentD\u2014where the parsing \nmagic happens\u2014sends the parsed log \nstream enriched with additional metadata \nto the Amazon OpenSearch service. \nThere, developers can view the logs using \npreconfigured dashboards in Kibana.  \n\nNot only did SoftServe\u2019s team of experts \ndeliver the components for the new \nAWS cloud-supported equities calibrator \napplication, but they also re-architected \nand re-wrote the legacy application and \nbuilt a new CI/CD microservices testing \nsolution. Once put into production, the \nclient saw the compelling proof for an AWS \ncloud migration at scale for other legacy \napplications. \n\nWe provided the solution in the \ninfrastructure as code format using \nCloudFormation. This format allows our \nclient to build repeatable and consistent \ninfrastructure processes across different \nenvironments and regions in the future. \n\nOur team also enabled reusing different \nbuild and deploy process components for \nmultiple microservices thanks to Jenkins \nshared CI/CD libraries. Lastly, the Helmfile \nconfiguration allowed the seamless \ndeployment of services in Amazon EKS. \nPlus, with documentation for all of these \ncomponents, the client can easily integrate \nnew AWS services as needed. \n\nUltimately, this solution transformed the \nlegacy equities branch of this financial \nservices company. It reduced calibration \ntimes up to 90%, which allowed equity \ntraders to provide near real-time responses \nto their customers\u2019 inquiries. In turn, \nthis increased the number of successful \ncustomer requests. By providing an AWS \nCloud backed solution, SoftServe made our \nclient\u2019s equities division more competitive \nand enabled its growth into other \ngeographic markets.\n\nLET\u2019S TALK about how SoftServe can \nincrease your business\u2019 scalability and \nstability with AWS and cloud-native \nsolutions.\n\ncase study |    AWS Cloud Modernization Use Case 5\n\nhttps://www.softserveinc.com/en-us/contact\n\n\nABOUT SOFTSERVE\n\nWe are a digital authority made up of advisors, engineers, and designers \nwho deliver innovation, quality, and speed to elevate and accelerate our \nclients\u2019 digital journeys.\n\nOur approach is built on a foundation of empathetic, human-focused \nexperience design that ensures value and continuity from concept to \nrelease.\n\nWE IDENTIFY WHERE YOU ARE.                   \nWE PREPARE YOU FOR THE ROAD AHEAD.\u00a0 \nWE TAKE YOU WHERE YOU NEED TO GO.\u00a0\nVisit our website, blog, LinkedIn, Facebook, and Twitter pages.\n\nNORTH AMERICAN HQ\n\n201 W 5th Street, Suite 1550 \nAustin, TX 78701 \nUSA +1 866 687 3588 (USA)           \n+1 647 948 7638 (Canada) \n\nEUROPEAN HQ\n\n30 Cannon Street\nLondon EC4M 6XH\nUnited Kingdom  \n+44 333 006 4341\n\ninfo@softserveinc.com \nwww.softserveinc.com\n\n\n", "LocationURL": "https://www.softserveinc.com/files/cases/aws-cloud-modernization-financial-services.pdf", "id": "sw-rf-802", "FileName": "aws-cloud-modernization-financial-services.pdf", "Storage": "SoftServe Website", "Published": "2021-11-16T09:37:35Z", "FileType": ".pdf"}, {"Category": null, "content": "\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "LocationURL": "https://info.softserveinc.com/hubfs/files/esg-strategies-for-finance.pdf", "id": "sw-rf-835", "FileName": "esg-strategies-for-finance.pdf", "Storage": "SoftServe Website", "Published": "2022-06-29T13:07:40Z", "FileType": ".pdf"}, {"Category": null, "content": "\nZENDESK INTEGRATION \nFOR MICROSOFT TEAMS\n\nCASE \nSTUDY\n\nBuilding and supporting \n\n\n\nOverview\n\nIn a collaborative effort, SoftServe created an upgraded Microsoft Teams application \nintegration for Zendesk.

Where there is the \nword \u201cdigital,\u201d there is an ever-growing demand for software development. \nTrying to keep your hand on the pulse of this allegedly vague term and \npush it even further should be your burning ambition.\n\nAs the call for software services is increasing over time, the approach to \nthem doesn\u2019t remain standing, having moved from desktop to web and \nnow to the cloud, mobile, IoT, VR, etc. To quote a well-known comic book, \nwith great power comes great responsibility: with the advancement of \ntechnologies and platforms to be supported, quality requirements are \nalso building up, causing the amount of QA work to increase flat-out. That \nis when test automation became a buzzword, firmly holding the fort up \nuntil now. It has never been standing still, but rather rapidly developing \nto fulfill a pressing industry need in tools, instruments and approaches \nto reduce time-to-market and related expenses without compromising \nquality of the product. Let\u2019s take a sneak peek on test automation changes \nand challenges, and how to get your company shaped up for them.\n\nAgile Is the Key \n\nThe first thing to mention is that industry keeps relying on agile \nmethodologies when it comes to software development. In short \niterations and continuous delivery (CD) environment of agile projects, \ntest automation is almost invaluable for covering regression testing and \nmeeting tight deadlines. According to Capgemini\u2019s research, a number \nof agile projects increased by 36 percent compared to the previous year, \nwhile the percentage of automated tests increased by 45 percent as \nopposed to 28 percent in 2014. What\u2019s more, to meet these deadlines, QAs \nhave to cooperate with Devs hand-in-hand, which blurs the line between \n\nhttp://virtual-strategy.com/2016/08/17/automate-can-latest-trends-test-automation/\nhttp://response.softserveinc.com/dec/%3Futm_source%3Dabm-02apr16%26utm_medium%3Dunited-bloglanding-page%26utm_campaign%3Dsocial\nhttps://united.softserveinc.com/blogs/time-to-become-digital-enterprise/%3Futm_source%3Dabm-02apr16%26utm_medium%3Dunited-bloglanding-page%26utm_campaign%3Dsocial\nhttps://www.softserveinc.com/en-us/services/software-testing/\nhttp://response.softserveinc.com/approaching-quality\nhttp://response.softserveinc.com/approaching-quality\nhttps://www.capgemini.com/thought-leadership/world-quality-report-2016-17\nhttps://united.softserveinc.com/blog/sharing-agile-principles/\n\n\nwhite paper\n\nTHE LaTEsT TrEnds in TEsT auTomaTion 3\n\nthe two roles: QAs are developing test automation items and CI parts, \nwhile developers are commonly using a TDD approach and are often \ninvolved in performance testing, making the app automatable and other \ntesting-related duties. There is a bit of Dev in every QA, and vice versa.\n\nDevOps: The Best of Both Worlds\n\nThe popularity of agile also encouraged a gradual spread of DevOps, the \ngolden term meaning combining the best of development and operations \nworlds. DevOps engineers help developers and QAs to focus on coding and \ntesting, rather than setting up and supporting application infrastructure \nand various test and dev environments. Based on numerous cases \nfrom my own experience, DevOps is THE thing and has occupied a well-\ndeserved role of a buzzword too, along with test automation and Agile.\n\nDevOps engineers themselves are knee-deep in automation as well, in a \nslightly different way though. What makes automation one of the chief \ningredients in cloud services (read more below) is dynamic control panels \nand markedly adaptable configurations. Bringing up these automation \nlayers via additional services and APIs, cloud providers enable businesses \nto stage, test and deploy new software automatically from CD tools that \nput the software pipeline together. This makes QAs\u2019 and Devs\u2019 lives easier.\n\nKeep Your Head in the Cloud\n\nSpeaking of test and dev, one should mention what these environments \nrely on: virtualization and cloud platforms such as AWS. By preparing \nneeded virtual images in advance, time spent for setting up these \nenvironments may be significantly reduced and if something goes wrong, it \nis always possible to roll back to the initial image state. In addition, DevOps \nengineers can automate this process so your environment is ready for test \nruns with a click of the button (all right, all right, and maybe a few minutes \nof waiting). Add here some scripts for code compilation and deployment \nand you will get a lion\u2019s share of your CI process ready. Neat.\n\nhttps://www.comparethecloud.net/articles/understanding-devops-in-2016/\n\n\nwhite paper\n\nTHE LaTEsT TrEnds in TEsT auTomaTion 4\n\nOpen Your Source\n\nWhen the IT industry realized that the cost of software is high, an open source \nstarted playing the first fiddle in product development. The most popular \nmodern software tools are open source. And even though test automation \ntools are far from being exclusively open source, the tendency is clearly \nchanging with its focus shifting from vendor tools to open source tools paired \nwith infrastructure provider services, such as Sauce Labs, BlazeMeter, etc. \nHere\u2019s a guideline for beginners to get armed with free services and set \nfoot in open source:\n\nhttps://united.softserveinc.com/blog/open-source-initiative-good-for-business/\n\n\nwhite paper\n\nTHE LaTEsT TrEnds in TEsT auTomaTion 5\n\nSecurity Testing Is Your Best Friend\n\nWithout having to say it, integrating security into an entire software \ndevelopment life cycle (SDLC)\u2014from A to Z (where T obviously stands \nfor Testing)\u2014will prevent you from the undesired post-breach remorse. \nArranging one security checkup is good, but having a thought-of security \ntesting plan is even better. And that, kids, is how I met continuous \nintegration and dynamic scan: launching code analysis tools along with \nautomation testing (i.e., implementing them into a CI process) before a \nrelease will save you time, money and nerve cells. The goal is to achieve \nthe following pipeline: CI performs code analysis, compiles and tests an \napplication on a daily basis (the more, the better); then every change that \npasses the automated tests is deployed to production automatically. This \nallows dev and test teams to dig up issues bright and early, avoid human \nerrors and detect bugs right away.\n\nMay JavaScript Be with You\n\nA due pinch of recognition should be laid upon JavaScript test automation \ntools and frameworks. As the demand for test automation is snowballing, \nmore and more QA engineers are looking into writing tests with JavaScript \nfor a number of solid reasons: not only is it easy to be learned, but it also \nhas a huge community, which means there is always someone to offer \na helping hand if you are stuck. This enthusiasm is mutual: JavaScript \ndevelopers are also inquiring into test automation, which results in a \nmuch-needed boost in the amount of JavaScript test automation tools and \nlibraries. Most of these tools are not as mature as the similar ones used with \nJava (as an example), but the scope of attention and a tempo of their growth \nshowcases that JavaScript test automation will soon become a big thing.\n\nhttps://united.softserveinc.com/blogs/best-practices-dev-test-cloud-microsoft-azure/\n\n\nwhite paper\n\nTHE LaTEsT TrEnds in TEsT auTomaTion 6\n\nMobile Is Still the New Black\n\nSince the early days of a single ruling desktop have gone with the wind, the \nroad of enterprise mobility and mobile applications leads to more testing, \nwhich in turn triggers QA engineers to look for tools to automate their \nwork. Having realized it, the majority of infrastructure services are now \noffering cloud mobile devices for testing and automation. Fun fact: Appium, \na very popular test automation framework for use with native, hybrid and \nmobile web apps, is open source and is built around JavaScript stack.\n\nWeb Services Testing Is In-Thing\n\nAnother area of test automation that is capturing attention because of the \nindustry-related trends is web services testing. When a web application \nis growing on different components within different distributed teams, it \nbecomes difficult to manage monolithic applications and keep high quality. \nThe solution appears to be simple: split a monolithic application into \nmicroservices with completely isolated codebases which can be deployed \nindependently.  So, many web applications are adopting microservices \narchitecture which means that a web application should be built as a \nsum of small independent services. This pattern changes the approach \nof testing such applications toward testing individual services and their \nintegrations with each other. As microservices architecture remains a \ngo-go when it comes to web applications, a call for this sort of testing will \nspring up.\n\nBottom Line\n\nLegit test automation performance is no longer just an increased amount \nof script code. Pushed by today\u2019s software defined world, the nucleus \nof test automation is moving away from rather conservative regression \nand smoke-type coverage to nonfunctional requirements. The scope of \nautomation goes up substituting routine testing more and more, which lets \nengineers focus on context-bound issues.\n\nBy Pavlo Vedilin\n\nhttp://appium.io/\nhttps://united.softserveinc.com/blog/open-source-initiative-good-for-business/\nhttps://united.softserveinc.com/members/pavlo-vedilin/\n\n\nwhite paper\n\nTHE LaTEsT TrEnds in TEsT auTomaTion 7\n\nAbout SoftServe\n\nWith over 20 years of experience in digital software development and \nconsulting, SoftServe is a global leader in solving complex business \nproblems, creating industry disrupting technology and accelerating growth \nand innovation while optimizing operational efficiency.

In a recent survey, 67% of organizations classified \nthemselves as either \u201cpure agile\u201d or \u201cleaning towards agile.\u201d And in another, 98% of \nrespondents said that their organization has realized success from agile projects.\n\nIn this white paper, we\u2019ll explore why and how to redesign a legacy software development \nlifecycle (SDLC) to go from waterfall to agile, and transitioning to test automation to fit  \nthis model.\n\nWhat Does \u201cGoing Agile\u201d Mean?\nGoing agile is great for projects that have tight deadlines. In theory, agile software \ndevelopment means implementing shorter iterations and more frequent delivery. In practice, \nthis means that there are no roadmaps or requirements; the project begins with a lower \nquality product that goes through multiple, rapid iterations until it reaches its final stage.\n\nOn the front end, the agile method allows for changing priorities as they appear, and  \nis perfect for projects that require a fast turnaround. At SoftServe, we advise and consult  \non the best practices for each particular project, and use metrics and data to transform  \nthe process.\n\n2whitepaper | Be More Agile: Redesign Your SDLC\n\nAnalysis\n\nDesign\n\nCode\n\nTest\n\nAnalysis\n\nDesign\n\nCode\n\nTest\n\nTimeTime\n\nAgile SDLC  \u2013 Simultaneous ActivitiesSDLC  \u2013 Sequential Activities\n\nhttps://techbeacon.com/survey-agile-new-norm\nhttp://www.agile247.pl/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/versionone-11th-annual-state-of-agile-report.pdf\n\n\nOn the back end, it\u2019s important to have the ability to adjust and react quickly. To accomplish \nthis type of speed requires high team morale and a collaborative attitude. A conflict with any \ntechnical product management group can usually be resolved by hiring a technical product \nmanager, who can be brought on-site to bridge any gaps between teams. Without the \ncooperation of the entire team, communication becomes impossible and the project will fall \napart. We will revisit this idea again later.\n\nTesting and Project Management: Agile vs. Traditional\n\nTransitioning to an agile methodology also requires rethinking your testing processes.\n\nTraditionally, testing was done manually and sequentially, which can be fine for smaller \nprojects but disastrous for larger ones. Manually testing for bugs and defects is time-\nconsuming and tedious, and for larger projects that require faster turnover rates, this creates \na lot of problems with time overhead. This traditional model is also outdated in that its main \npurpose is to find problems within the system, making it a reactive methodology instead of a \nproactive one.\n\nIn the agile SDLC, everything is set up to move much faster and more proactively. Say \nyou have two weeks to go live on something, with one or two days for testing. The agile \nmethodology works with these types of deadlines in mind, and can work even faster and \nmore thoroughly by implementing test automation. Test automation allows for bigger \nvolume-projects, and prevents bugs and defects instead of focusing on seeking them out.\n\nTest Automation\nTest automation is a second step that pairs with going agile \u2014 it\u2019s necessary in a fast-paced \nenvironment and shortens the turnaround cycle. Typical automation tests include unit \ntesting, integration testing, GUI testing, and performance testing.\n\n3whitepaper | Be More Agile: Redesign Your SDLC\n\nTraditional  (find bugs)\n\nUnit\nTests\n\nAutomation\nSuites\n\nManual Tests\nthrough UI\n\nAgile  (prevent bugs)\n\nAutomated UI Tests / \nExploratory Testing\n\nAutomated\nAcceptance Tests\n\nUnit\nTests\n\n\n\nAgile project development and its multiple rounds of iterations come with a greater number \nof automated test cases. Rather than manually checking their quality, which can waste time \nand overhead, quick assessment through test automation allows the project to move swiftly. \nTest automation also sheds light on both process and implementation findings that are easy \nto fix and better perfect the test solution.\n\nHere\u2019s a general overview for how to implement test automation.\n\nTest Automation in an Agile SDLC Process\n\nBut starting test automation can lead to failure without the experience of seasoned \nprofessionals. It\u2019s important to engage experienced experts to achieve the best and most \nvaluable automated quality testing.\n\n4whitepaper | Be More Agile: Redesign Your SDLC\n\nOne Time Activity Iterative\n\nDesign Develop Execute Maintain\n\nReview \nroadmap\n\nReview manual \ntest cases\n\nVerify testability\n\nSelection of \nautomation \ncandidates\n\nDefine tests \nstrategy\n\nRefactor \nmanual \ntests to be \nready for test \nautomation\n\nFramework \ndesign\n\nPlan reusable \nlibraries\n\nDefine other \nabstraction \nlayers\n\nData \nmanagement \nplan\n\nCreate test \nscripts\n\nData \nmanagement \n\nBuild execution \nflow\n\nRecovery \nscenarios\n\nAdd to function \nlibraries\n\nTool extensions\n\nRepository \nmanagement\n\nDocumentation\n\nCreate new test \nenvironment\n\nDeploy test \nsuite\n\nExecute test \nscripts \n\nResults \nreporting\n\nDefect \nmanagement\n\nUpdate assets\n\nArchive test \nsuite\n\nMaintain test \nsuite\n\nRegression \ntests\n\nPlan\n\n\n\nFinding the Right Partner to Redesign SDLC\nSuccess in going agile and implementing test automation is only as good as the team who \ncan successfully put it into action. At SoftServe, our teams have helped with countless SDLC \nredesign projects, such as helping Kyivstar redesign their SDLC to improve their mobile \nservices by up to 30%. Here are our secrets to success.\n\nOne of the most common reasons for failed outsourcing projects \nis insufficient attention given to setting and aligning expectations, \nunderstanding real needs behind formal requirements, and further \ngovernance of the project execution.\n\nSetting the Right Goals\nWhen it comes to redesigning an SDLC, the best approach starts with successful \ncollaboration and clear project goals \u2014 especially when implementing the agile \nmethodology. Things move more quickly, and so the right objectives need to be set with the \nfull support of all parties. The best way to do this is to uncover potential project challenges \nfrom the very beginning to help you get the full set of benefits that come from outsourcing.\n\nAt SoftServe, our process focuses on analyzing team structure, development processes, \nbusiness domains and tools, as well as identifying gaps, risks, and opportunities that need to \nbe addressed in order to refine and optimize the entire collaboration process.\n\nAn effective workshop is conducted at a client\u2019s site and brings together key stakeholders \nwho will be impacted by the outsourcing initiative.\n\nWorkshops take from 3 to 6 hours and consist of group discussions and individual follow-ups \non things such as:\n\n \u2022 Expectations and value management\n \u2022 Sourcing opportunity analysis\n \u2022 Engagement approach definition\n \u2022 Current project, process, product management practices\n \u2022 Knowledge management\n \u2022 Measurement of quality, productivity and predictability\n\n5whitepaper | Be More Agile: Redesign Your SDLC\n\nhttps://www.softserveinc.com/en-us/news/softserve-transforms-and-optimizes-kyivstar-sdlc/\n\n\nMonitoring Execution vs. Goals\nSuccessful projects rely on a careful balance of monitoring execution against the goals  \nthat are set in place. Important metrics provide insight as to the velocity and quality  \nof estimates, quality/issues open/reopen, cycle time, and other product quality  \nassessment measurements.\n\nAt SoftServe, our Abiliton dashboard tracks projects and metrics, using them as a measuring \ntool to gauge project success. When switching to an agile environment, keeping track of \nproject timelines and goals is imperative. Velocity and quality estimates allow you to uncover \nhow much time your team needs to produce quality product value.\n\nThe best, most commonly used quality measurements include:\n\n \u2022 The number of issues open\n \u2022 The number of issues fixed\n \u2022 And the number of issues re-opened\n\nFinding the Right Technology Experts\nRedesigning a legacy software development process requires expertise. In a fast-moving, \nagile development process, it\u2019s more important than ever to rely on those who have \nsuccessfully accomplished these projects before.\n\nAt SoftServe, we use our market-leading methodology to seek out and maintain a team \nof technology experts. We have a unique approach to software development based on \nthe effective team work of highly qualified professionals, the use of agile development \nmethodology, and advanced technologies. These things improve the software  \ndevelopment process.\n\nConclusion\nThe agile software development model is better equipped to handle the technological \npace of our time. With this model comes faster project turnover rates, which makes test \nautomation preferable over traditional manual testing. Contact SoftServe for a smooth \ntransition from traditional and/or waterfall models, and activate experienced experts who \nare the best people for the job.\n\n6whitepaper | Be More Agile: Redesign Your SDLC\n\n\n\nABOUT US\nSoftServe is a global digital authority and consulting company, operating \nat the cutting edge of technology.

This organization provides a  \ncost-effective way for agile pricing and intelligent billing solutions to \ntransform the back-end operations of the businesses and turn them  \ninto a competitive advantage.\n\nFounded in 2008, today our client powers a wide range of publicly traded \nand privately held companies from traditional industries to IoT, cloud apps, \nand high-tech enterprises. They assure top-line revenue growth, faster \ntime-to-market, visibility into revenue streams, and operational savings.\n\n\n\nBusiness Challenge\n\nThe client\u2019s product is an internet-scale monetization and revenue automation platform \ndesigned to manage simple to sophisticated billing and payment transactions. People use this \nsoftware to monetize and quickly bring to market new products and services. The client set out \nto develop a project for Representational State Transfer (REST) web services that would allow \nenlarging the amount of sources billing data could retrieve, building them on top of existing \nsoftware infrastructure, and assuring the security of business resources.\n\nProject Description\n\nThe project was comprised of four architecture layers. The web service application was \nimplemented on the top API layer served to define REST. The business logic of the project \nwas implemented on the Spring framework-based service layer. The database layer was \nresponsible for integrating with all data sources such as MySQL, PostgreSQL, and ElasticSearch. \nAnd the domain layer was a \u201ccross-layer\u201d module which consisted of business object models \nused in all architecture layers.\n\nIn order to complete the project, SoftServe experts decided to apply a requirements-driven \ndevelopment framework. This approach enabled the Swagger Code Generation application \nto create an interface for easily developing and consuming an API by effectively mapping all \nthe initial java classes, resources, models, and operations associated with them on Swagger \nYAML. This approach gave the developers the opportunity to edit generated classes and add \nfurther business logic. It was powered by Amazon SWF, a fully-managed state tracker and task \ncoordinator, which helped developers build, run, and scale background jobs that had parallel \nor sequential steps.\n\nValue Delivered\n\nThe solution delivered by the team of engineers from SoftServe reflected a modern approach \nto software development and provided an outstanding solution for our client. Due to the \nsuccessful deployment of the project, developers managed to significantly improve the \nperformance of the current system. The newly-implemented solution enabled the controlling \nof the system\u2019s components, storing client data, maintaining the database, and processing \ndata flows from heterogeneous sources on another qualitative level, making the embedded \nsoftware a primary tool for managing data objects.\n\n2case study | Solution Augments Billing Data Capacity for Cloud-Based Monetization Leader\n\n\n\nABOUT US\n\nSoftServe is a global digital authority and consulting company, operating at \nthe cutting edge of technology.

Nationwide, more than \n160,000 physicians, 800 hospitals and thousands of other \nhealthcare providers in clinics, post-acute care facilities, and \nhomecare agencies, use the client\u2019s solutions to automate and \nconnect their clinical and business operations.\n\nBusiness Challenge\n\nAs a joint effort, Allscripts and SoftServe designed a Homecare \nsystem to improve the clinical quality of care, financial \nperformance, and operational control for large, integrated home \ncare organizations, as well as small home care agencies. \n\nDISTRIBUTED AGILE PRACTICE \nFOR THE HEALTHCARE \nSOLUTION\n\n\n\ncase study |    Distributed Agile Practice for the Healthcare Solution 2\n\nThe SoftServe team also provided full maintenance to Allscripts Homecare throughout \nthe entire project on a release-by-release basis.\n\nIn the early releases, product development followed a traditional, Waterfall development \nmodel. As the product became more complex, a more advanced methodology became \ncritical. Allscripts and SoftServe agreed to move from a Waterfall to an Agile software \ndevelopment approach.\n\nBenefits of Agile include:\n\n\u2022 Ensuring a business approach that \naligns development with customer \nneeds and company goals\n\n\u2022 Collaborating between cross- functional \nteams, which include business analysts, \ndevelopers, test engineers and technical \nwriters\n\n\u2022 Providing immediate feedback from the \nproduct owner and end-users on newly \ndeveloped parts of the product\n\n\u2022 Demonstrating ongoing progress that \nreduces surprises\n\n\u2022 Delivering high-quality software\n\nProject Description\n\nAgile methodology included conducting regular meetings with the SCRUM teams and a \nProduct Owner. The Product Owner played a critical role in achieving the project success in \nscope of Agile methodology, he/she:\n\n\u2022 Defined and prioritized the user stories of the product\n\u2022 Defined the Product Backlog content on a release date\n\u2022 Adjusted features and priority before each sprint\n\u2022 Performed acceptance testing of every user story\n\u2022 Accepted or rejected the work results\n\nAnother important player in Agile development is the Client Focus Group that helped the \nProduct Owner prioritize the user stories. The Focus Group role was even more critical \nduring the product demonstrations, since they generated immediate feedback on the \nnewly developed product features or functionalities, while capturing the most valued parts \nof the product. The Product Owner was the link between the development team and the \nclient, ensuring the product development complied with the customer\u2019s requirements, as \nwell as meeting the customer\u2019s needs.\n\nThe SCRUM Master\u2019s meetings were held to encourage maximum collaboration among \nteams, coordinate cross-team priorities, and provide more flexible change management.\n\nIn the scope of Agile, the SoftServe team, with the Product Owner, conducted 15-30 minute \nSCRUM meetings. The daily meetings helped to identify any task issues. At the beginning of \neach sprint, the SCRUM team had a planning meeting to do the following:\n\n\n\ncase study |    Distributed Agile Practice for the Healthcare Solution 3\n\n\u2022 Discuss and prioritize user stories\n\u2022 Assign tasks for completing a user story to the team of developers, test engineers and \n\ntechnical writers\n\u2022 Define the acceptance criteria for each user story\n\nAfter completing the discussions and clarifications, the team presented their vision of \nfunctionality that was to be implemented within the sprint to the Product Owner to ensure \nalignment.\n\nA retrospective meeting was held at the end of each sprint to discuss what was \naccomplished and the results.\n\nTypically this took the form of a demonstration of the functionalities implemented within \nthe user stories.\n\nEach new project started with a Zero sprint so the team could analyze, prioritize, and \nestimate each user story.\n\nThe teams used the following online communicators and video conferencing tools to \nenable frequent and easy communication:\n\nAdditional tools included:\n\n\u2022 MS SharedView\n\u2022 SharePoint\n\n\u2022 WebEx\n\u2022 CollabNet\n\nValue Delivered\n\nAs people are at the heart of every SoftServe project success, it is important to have the \nright people, in the right place, at the right time to keep the project moving smoothly \nbeyond the techniques and processes.\n\nAgile methodology was the basis for strong communications between our integrated \nteams, and fostered continuous feedback and collaboration.\n\nAs the result of Agile we were able to successfully integrate the work load of developers, \ntest engineers and technical writers. We conducted frequent team meetings allowing \nSoftServe to deliver the transparency Allscripts required.\n\n\n\ncase study |    Distributed Agile Practice for the Healthcare Solution 4\n\n\u201cMoving to an Agile team model from a Waterfall model can be disruptive and somewhat \nintimidating for team members. Whereas with Waterfall, most communications between \nAllscripts business analysts and SoftServe were through senior-level team members, with \nAgile, all team members are in regular communication with each other and about people \nand communication. I\u2019m proud that the team members at Allscripts and SoftServe adapted \nto Agile so collaboratively and quickly, taking advantage of the benefits an Agile process \ncan bring to improve both the quantity and quality of the deliverables for our customers\u201d, \nsays Dave Staudenmaier, Director, Product Development at Allscripts.\n\nBoth Allscripts and SoftServe recognize the benefits of using Agile methodology on \ntheir complex and long-term projects. Agile development methodology increased \ncommunication between customers and business analysts, and eliminated needless work \nload for the development and QA teams, which in turn reduced the product development \ncost. With an Agile approach a significantly higher percentage of the projects were \ndelivered on-time and on-budget.\n\nOverall, Allscripts valued the increased responsiveness to change, the accelerated time to \nmarket, and the improvements to quality and efficiency.\n\n\n\nABOUT US\nSoftServe is a digital authority that advises and provides at the \ncutting-edge of technology.

It offers a full range of banking services to corporate and \nretail customers. They are a part of the Consortium, which is one \nthe largest privately owned investment groups, with interests in \ncommercial and investment banking, asset management, insurance, \nand retail trade. \n\nThe bank provides a wide range of retail banking products and \nservices, including deposit and current accounts, loans, credit and \ndebit card services, cash and settlement services, money transfer \nservices, and services to individual clients. According to the official \nNational Bank of Ukraine, as of January 1, 2014 the Client was one \nof the top 20 largest banks in Ukraine in terms of total assets, the \neighth-largest in terms of loans to individuals, and the tenth-largest \nin terms of customer accounts.\n\nSINGLE-WINDOW SYSTEM \nFOR A EUROPEAN BANK TO \nIMPROVE CUSTOMER SERVICE \nAND LOWER EXPENSES\n\n\n\ncase study |   Single-Window System for a European Bank to Improve Customer Service and Lower Expenses 2\n\nBusiness Challenge\n\nResponding to market trends, the client began to increase their business in retail banking \nproducts and services. In the course of expanding their branch network, the bank faced \nchallenges in front office automation. At that time they were using three to eight different \ninformation systems and databases to sell bank products. This resulted in service taking \ntoo long for clients, as well as security issues and excessive costs for onboarding and \ntraining of employees. The client needed a new solution to avoid the complicated process \nof selling a bank product or service. \n\nIn addition, they had been growing hand-in-hand with the market, constantly improving \ntheir business process to meet all challenges and demands. Their solution had to be \nflexible and ready for changes with minimal modifications, perhaps even using a zero-\ncode approach.\n\nProject Description\n\nSoftServe offered the client an \u201canalysis phase\u201d for gathering all business and technical \nrequirements to build a solution vision. As a result, the final version of the solution was \nselected and agreed upon. The SoftServe team also developed a proof of concept to \ndemonstrate its feasibility.\n\nSoftServe proposed a system that would lead a user through the sales process, letting \nthem fill in all necessary data, take a photo, and print and sign documents. Given the \nneed to easily modify of the system, SoftServe developed a process engine for process \nmanagement, binding various steps and defining the rules for transition between them. \n\nSoftServe also implemented a main front-office solution with functions such as viewing and \nmanaging existing client products and services, as well as working with open and archived \nclient orders. In addition, sales processes for all required banking products and services \nwere realized. Communication and interaction with other systems within the bank was \nbased on the principles of service-oriented architecture (SOA), with enterprise service bus as \nan additional layer. These provide the required level of isolation while also providing service \nfunctions like transport, monitoring, data transformation, etc.\n\nValue Delivered\n\nThe solution implemented by SoftServe: \n\n\u2022 Decreases and maximizes client service time.  \n\u2022 Reduces costs for the education of new employees by being more userfriendly and simple. \n\u2022 Reduced the load of the support team, as it\u2019s web-based, working in a web-browser \n\nwithout supplementary installation software.  \n\u2022 Provides better security by eliminating the saving of sensitive client data on user\u2019s desktop.\n\n\n\nABOUT US\nSoftServe is a digital authority that advises and provides at the \ncutting-edge of technology.

There\u2019s no doubt it\u2019s a hot topic, and \nrightly so. AI has enormous potential to reshape business. When properly leveraged, AI \nsolutions drive efficiency, optimize processes, and enhance experiences. In a global study \npublished by the Boston Consulting Group and MIT Sloan Management Review, 84% of the \n3,000 business leaders interviewed expect AI to give them a competitive advantage.\n\nDespite the interest, AI is underutilized in many of today\u2019s industries. Only 23% of the \nleaders surveyed have already incorporated AI into their business models. This could put \nbusinesses that aren\u2019t utilizing AI at a huge disadvantage compared to companies that \nhave already adopted the technology and excel at its integration.\n\nArtificial intelligence is not a replacement for human intelligence. On the contrary, AI \nperpetually learns and delivers human interactions, while saving us time by eliminating the \nwasted motion and human error associated with redundant tasks.\n\nBlinded by buzzwords\n\nIs AI or intelligent automation (IA) better? How does AI and IA work? These are a few of the \nquestions to ask when deciding how AI can best be leveraged.\n\nAI is essentially made up of computer systems that \u201clearn\u201d from patterns sensed and \nsynthesized from vast amounts of big data to perform tasks that normally require human \nintelligence. Such tasks include visual perception, speech recognition, decision-making, \nand translation between languages. Voice-powered personal assistants like Siri and Alexa, \nAmazon recommendations, and Google Translate are common examples of AI.\n\nIntelligent automation (IA) is a mix of augmented and amplified intelligence\u2014loosely defined \nas the combination of artificial intelligence with automation\u2014and includes natural language \nprocessing, machine learning, and machine vision. IA is an application of AI that automates \nentire processes or workflows, learning and adapting as they go. Examples include making \ndecisions about textual information to guide autonomous vehicles and advanced robots. \n\nhttps://sloanreview.mit.edu/projects/reshaping-business-with-artificial-intelligence/\n\n\nwhitepaper | Artificial Intelligence: Revolutionize Business Today 3\n\nAI isn\u2019t a universal technology, but is rather composed of building blocks that\u2014\nindividually or in concert\u2014adds intelligence to applications. Its intricacies depend on \nwhat information is sought, and whether that information can be gleaned from the \ndata. And since data is gathered across departments and companies at a variety of \ndifferent touchpoints, increasing the amount of data that fuels AI systems makes them \nexponentially smarter and more effective.\n\nThe proper toolkit\n\nTo leverage AI, matching requirements with the right technology to ensure the right \napplication is vital. Proper AI matching depends on two important factors\u2014big data and \ndomain knowledge. Without these components, AI simply cannot work.\n\nBig data is necessary to glean patterns for effective AI\u2014but not just any big data will do. \nThe intricacy of the problem depends on specific data location, flow of data, quality of \ndata, and system integration. Often, despite a promising use case and a large amount of \ndata, AI cannot be implemented due to signals and patterns that ultimately don\u2019t align.\n\nPlatforms\u2014such as Google Cloud and Amazon Web Service\u2014lower the barrier of entry \nand make AI readily available. They include frameworks for developing, testing, and \ntraining machine learning models as well as leveraging pre-built models as appropriate. \nDespite the user-friendly nature of these platforms, subject matter and AI domain \nexpertise are necessary for complex problem solving.\n\nSpeaking of automation\n\nForrester reports that \u201c\u2026the future of robotic process automation (RPA) lies with \ncognitive-AI enhancement\u2014due to its ability to solve more business problems in a more \nsophisticated fashion.\u201d Advances in machine learning techniques, improvements in \nsensors, and an increase in computing power have helped create a new generation of \nhardware and software robots with practical applications in nearly every industry sector. \n\nWhy? Because automation does not require complex thought processes, and it minimizes \nhuman error that comes with performing repetitive tasks. \n\nhttps://go.forrester.com/blogs/automation-ai-and-robotics-are-critical-cio-targets/\n\n\nwhitepaper | Artificial Intelligence: Revolutionize Business Today 4\n\nSome assembly required\n\nDon\u2019t believe what the movies portray. Despite AI\u2019s ability to \u201clearn\u201d and distinguish \npatterns, artificial intelligence is not alive. It is an impersonal, back-end process that is \ncapable of producing unpredictable outcomes. \n\nNor is AI the solution to every challenge. Ignoring this fact can be costly on many levels.\n\nAt SoftServe, our teams work with clients to identify where AI is the right fit, and assess \nwhat it will take to implement compared to the projected value it will deliver.\n\nThere are four kinds of AI project classifications\n\n\u2022 Simple solutions\u2014Easy implementation for some added value\n\u2022 Quick wins\u2014Easy implementation that brings significant value\n\u2022 Must-haves\u2014Hard to create and execute but brings significant value\n\u2022 Impossibilities\u2014Hard to implement and does not bring value\n\nBefore assuming that AI is the answer, assess the nature of the problem itself: Is AI the \nbest solution? Is the problem solvable with AI? Is there an easier way to solve the problem \nwithout implementing AI?\n\nConclusion\n\nAI is a cutting-edge technology that increases efficiency and speed\u2014ultimately making our \nlives easier. Instead of spending significant time and energy on tedious or repetitive tasks, \nAI speeds the process, saving valuable time. But AI needs a proper assessment before \nimplementation to ensure that it is the best option for a business challenge.\n\nTo learn how to use tomorrow\u2019s technology today, contact SoftServe.\n\n\u2022 1.\n\u2022 2.\n\u2022 3.\n\u2022 4.\n\n\n\nABOUT US\nSoftServe is a global digital authority and consulting company, operating \nat the cutting edge of technology.

For the business, this translates to the ability to get products to the market faster \nin their minimal form then continuously enhance usability, features, and performance. \n\nDevOps requires a strong backend architecture along with expert knowledge around \nthe technical components such as continuous integration and delivery, code as \ninfrastructure, containerization, and micro-services. However, the practice of DevOps is \nonly truly successful if a culture of \u201crelease early and often\u201d is in place between business \nstakeholders, development teams, and operations support. \n\nDevOps success stories are abundant in tech blogs and industry publications and has been \ncredited with helping large enterprises launch new offerings, save money, and change the \nculture of their organizations.\n\nDataOps \n\nIn an age where contextual and personalized experiences drive consumer engagement, \ncollecting actionable data from customers and then using these insights to create a \nhyper-personalized experience is critical\u2014but collection alone is not enough. How the \ndata is ingested, normalized, checked for accuracy, managed, and made available to the \norganization is equally important. \n\nEnter DataOps\u2014the practice of using the proper set of tools, processes, and behaviors \naround working with data. It combines best practice elements from platform data science \nand data architecture with the corporate cultural paradigm of treating data as a first class-\ncitizen.\n\nTechnology\n\nWhen working with data, success is heavily dependent on having the appropriate set of \nintegrated tools necessary to manage the data across its lifecycle and various workflows \nthroughout the organization. Data exists in varying formats and states of readiness for \nconsumption either by applications, data scientists, or business users. It\u2019s vital to data\u2019s \nintegrity to have the right infrastructure to not only ingest and store data, but also \nnormalize, scrub, aggregate, and vet the data. This infrastructure must also model and \nprepare for machine learning and provide robust security. To handle the vast amounts of \ndata being captured by businesses today and optimize personalization at scale, businesses \nshould look to the Cloud.   \n\nYour company may also consider unifying systems to position business logic closer to data \nsources for real-time analysis enablement\u2014especially when it comes to use cases such as \nmaking recommendations based on activity, location, or even personality.\n\nhttps://techbeacon.com/10-companies-killing-it-devops\n\n\nwhitepaper | From DevOps to DataOps 3\n\nProcesses and Policies\n\nWorking with data captured (or shared by your customers) carries a factor of mutual trust. \nOr if you\u2019re doing business in Europe, data capture is a highly regulated practice under \nthe new GDPR laws. In either case, there is a responsibility to avoid improper usage or the \nreleasing of PII/PID information. DataOps practices define the processes around the use of \ndata as well as policies for the safeguarding of data sets and individual sensitive elements. \n\nUnderstanding the risks and ensuring data security is only a part of compliance. \nCompanies must also ensure that policies are effectively communicated and enforced \ncorporatewide. A proper DataOps strategy aids in that risk awareness.\n\nData for the people\n\nThe democratization of data will ultimately enable your company to truly transform the \nway it works. A well-known data scientist once told me, \u201c\u2026the most important thing about \nworking with data is knowing the right questions to ask\u201d. I recall those words each time I have \ndiscussions about a company\u2019s vast data lakes and data warehouses. In many cases, the \ndata is not truly understood and there is no clear picture of what knowledge is hoped for \nthrough the capture and analysis of said data.\n\nHumanizing data is an element of DataOps that makes analytics consumable and \nactionable, but the end goal of working with data is not to create a chart, graph, or \ndashboard\u2014it\u2019s about changing behavior. Humanizing the data means breaking through \ntechnology and process topics to really consider whose behavior we\u2019re trying to change \nand why. I have found that workshops using Design Thinking techniques and exercises \nare a powerful way to get to the root goal around working with data. Whether you choose \nto have these conversations in an interactive workshop setting or just in an informal \nstakeholder discussion, it\u2019s vital that these discussions happen. \n\nA DataOps strategy will not be successful unless the human elements of the data have \nbeen explored and are understood by all stakeholders. Beyond knowing what questions \nto ask, it\u2019s essential to know how to visualize the results in a way that makes sense to \neveryone as well as to know what actions should be taken based on data learnings. These \ndiscussions between those responsible for managing, interpreting, and acting will start to \nform a data-centric culture throughout the organization, transforming the way business \ndecisions get made. \n\n\n\nwhitepaper | From DevOps to DataOps 4\n\nConclusion\n\nA solid DataOps strategy will yield similar (if not more) success than enterprises are seeing \nleveraging modern DevOps practices. The tools, processes, and culture of working with \ndata will yield better insights into your customer\u2019s habits\u2014changing the way you view, \nserve, and anticipate wants and needs. \n\nSoftServe\u2019s Data Maturity model is a benchmark by which companies can assess where \nthey are in their data journey.

One of the central issues for the \norganization is dealing with Big Data analytics of investment portfolio scenarios. During \nprevious years, the client had three unsuccessful attempts to build a system that would \nenhance market risk management in portfolio analysis activities.\n\nSoftServe had conducted successful projects with the client before and was chosen to \nbuild a new iteration of this solution. \n\nThe client has more than 500 professional traders who each manages from one to a few \nhundred portfolios. More than five million open trades are active in the bank, including \nshares and derivatives (futures, options, etc.)\n\nEach day, the client\u2019s Market Risk Department analysts conduct the following activities:\n\n\u2022  Analyze market risks\n\u2022  Run simulations on stress testing according to uncovered risks (~20K scenarios)\n\u2022  Map these scenarios on investment portfolios\n\u2022  Process/an alyze billions of variants resulting from the mapping\n\u2022  Define the probability of negative scenarios and detect risky portfolios\n\u2022  Develop recommendations on potential actions for portfolio strategy enhancement \n\nand risk mitigation \n\nThe teams involved in these activities are:\n\n\u2022 The Portfolio Calculators (PC) \u2013 generate scenarios of potential portfolio behavior with \nrespect to obtained information on market risks \n\n\u2022  The Portfolio Analyzers (PA) \u2013 analyze portfolio data inputs (generated variants) in \norder to support financial trader with potential decision and actions to align with \noptimal portfolio strategy \n\nThe teams are separated by design to decrease any subjective mutual impacts. They \nhave to process huge volumes of data as billions of variants are generated by applying \n20,000 scenarios to five million active trades.

The platform collects large volumes of streaming data from the Portfolio\n\nCalculators and other departments within the bank. External predefined data sources \nmay also be included into the processing flow and contribute data into the data storage. \nThe RFDS hides big data complexity behind clear business oriented functions which other \nteams use, so any subjective influences on data are excluded.\n\nStreaming Framework is the second part of the developed solution. It retrieves data \nfrom the Kafka data messaging solution according to the Portfolio Analyzer specification, \nprocesses data (maps to scenarios, defines risks and deviations, etc.), and provides \ntransformed and enriched data to the RFDS. The Streaming Framework not only retrieves \ndata, but can enrich the data input from the Portfolio Calculator with the data provided by \nother departments to the data lake on a custom request of the Portfolio Analyzer. A huge \nvalue for the Portfolio Analyzer is that the system is able to process not only data provided \nby the Portfolio Calculator, but all types of data (both streaming and batch data) into its \nstorage by all predefined sources, including external ones. The Portfolio Analyzer gets \naccess to comprehensive, up-to-date and accurate data inputs for market risk analysis. \n \nInteraction with the full system is as follows:\n\n\u2022 The Portfolio Calculator, on daily basis, generates streaming data on calculated \nportfolio scenarios and sends it to data storage (data lake)\n\n\u2022 The Streaming Framework retrieves and maps this data to trades, defines risks and \ndeviations, and defines future potential variants for portfolios\n\n\u2022 When the data is processed The Streaming Framework stores it in the RFDS and sends \na notification to the Portfolio Calculator that the activity is completed successfully\n\n\u2022 The Portfolio Calculator team sends a request through API for report generation (data \nprovided in Parquet file, but may be also provided in other format, such as CSV on-\ndemand from the Portfolio Analyzer team)\n\n\u2022 The Portfolio Analyzer team retrieves this data report from RFDS, processes it in a \nstandalone analyzing system (developed separately), and provides data in a format \napplicable for a trader to process it for decision making. \n\n \nThe integrated solution was developed in tight timeframes with a team of only a few \ndedicated tech experts:\n\n\u2022 Risk Finder Data Services (RFDS) \u2013 1 year 8 months\n\u2022 Streaming Framework \u2013 1 year\n\n\n\ncase study Big Data Platform for Market Risk Management and Business Scenarios Processing for \nInvestment Bank\u2019s Portfolio Trading\n\n4\n\nValue Delivered\n\nThe system of two interconnected products developed by SoftServe has outstanding \nperformance and scalability.\n\nThe processing capacity of the system (number of trades and scenarios, required server \nand core quantity) is as follows:\n\n- Current capacity (solution already developed and tested):\n\n\u2022 5-9 million trades (depending on the business program) \n\u2022 16,000 risk scenarios\n\u2022 138 server nodes\n\u2022 2,760 cores on the cluster\n\u2022 37 TB memory on the cluster\n\u2022 2.6 PB of disk space on the cluster (260 TB currently used) \n\n- Testing capacity was used when developing the system \u2013 a cluster of the same size as \non production is used for testing.

From \npatient wearables to online medical records to unique applications, digital technology is \ncreating pathways for continuous communication and data exchange as never before. \nGiving rise to the term \u201cconnected health,\u201d devices, services, and interventions centered \naround the patient\u2019s needs are driving a quantum shift in every patient\u2019s healthcare journey, \nsupported by the shared information gathered by those same providers and devices. \n\nBut while the promise of a fully connected healthcare experience is certainly bright and \nattainable, the challenges need to be acknowledged and potential pitfalls addressed. \n\nConnecting patients and providers\n\nFor patients, access to care, information, and self-empowerment in their healthcare \njourney are made possible through digital technology. With such devices as biosensing \nwearables, patients can measure glucose, heart rate, and blood pressure, while insoles \nmeasure weight, balance, and temperature. New gadgets and applications allow patients \nto individually track levels or adjust programs to meet their needs and goals. Digital \ntechnology also improves access to medical records, labs, and doctors, and health \ninformation at unprecedented levels.\n\nThen there are the providers, who through these same devices have more (and more \nimmediate) access to their patients and their patients\u2019 information. Increased access does \nnot always require in-person access, as some devices reduce the need for on-site visits, \nwith providers capable of consulting remotely with more accuracy. Likewise, improved use \nof digital records, shared resources, knowledge, and expertise with other servicers and \nproviders closes gaps in information, optimizing time by reducing the time-consuming rote \ntasks, and freeing providers to focus instead more directly on patient care.\n\nDiagnosis\n\nThe future of the holistic healthcare ecosystem lies in the seamless integration and \nleveraging of these connected devices and systems, with patients digitally engaged, and \ncaregivers, providers, and practitioners willingly sharing data. \n\nTo even contemplate these increased levels of engagement and sharing, each facet \nin the system requires the right digital foundation. To increase patient engagement, \nsystems need to be simple, unifying, and efficient. To adequately support providers and \npractitioners, systems must offer accessibility to resources, scalability of services, and \noptimization of gathered intelligence. \n\nYet the shift toward a transformative healthcare ecosystem is not without challenges. \nMost of the aforementioned digital solutions have been developed individually, creating \nsignificant issues such as integration and interoperability for both consumers and payers/\nproviders. Even if successfully integrated, technical barriers arise\u2014one study found that \nconsumers may spend up to two and half hours addressing a technical problem. As user-\nbases grow and demands on applications and services increase, many face the challenges \nof scalability, ease-of-use, efficiency, and user optimization.\n\nhttps://patientengagementhit.com/news/what-is-the-role-of-connected-health-in-patient-engagement\nhttps://www.iotevolutionhealth.com/topics/iotevolutionhealth/articles/438613-new-patient-experience-model-drives-connected-healthcare-future.htm\n\n\nwhitepaper | Healthcare 3.0: The Doctor is Always In 3\n\nDespite growing pains, the healthcare ecosystem is taking shape, transforming \nexperiences as it develops. From scheduling a visit to the actual consultation to treatment \nand beyond, participants are adapting. Similarly, healthcare providers are learning as they \ngo and become more digital.\n\nLet\u2019s look at a few examples.\n\nRemedy one: Patient portal\n\nHealthcare today means multiple hospitals, inpatient and outpatient sites, pharmacies, \ninsurance agencies\u2014and millions of customers. To deliver services, many are choosing to \nupgrade patient portals to allow more efficiency in the delivery of services. By combining \ndisparate websites, apps, and communications into a single portal, patients (and \nproviders!) are able to get the information that they need quickly and easily. \n\nAWS is a leading cloud service known for its auto-scaling capabilities and comprehensive \nsolutions to assist with the rebuilding of the web portal. The AWS platform delivers \nthe HIPAA-compliant infrastructure required for storing and retrieving data for search \nfunctions, doctors, and the collection and tracking of portal metrics. Even a single portal \ncan mean drastic cost reduction, increased speed and page views, and greater patient \nsatisfaction.\n\nRemedy two: Cloud-based database\n\nFor healthcare businesses, relaying patient data in a secure and compliant manner is \nparamount. A cloud-based database provides an easy way for different players in the \nhealthcare ecosystem to connect directly with one another in healthcare delivery. \n\nFor cloud-based databases, AWS is able to offer support for critical offerings and improve \nfunctionality through faster, better services, facilitated searches, and complimentary \ncontent. The end result? HIPAA eligible database services that improve performance and \nlower costs to the organization. \n\nRemedy three: Cloud-enabled patient convenience\n\nMany patients are familiar with the difficulties of finding and scheduling a doctor\u2019s \nappointment. The cloud enables patients to schedule appointments on digital \nplatforms, decreasing both the time it takes to see a doctor and time wasted on the \npart of physicians\u2014simultaneously. This cloud-enabled patient convenience also makes \nappointment scheduling scalable. \n\nUsing AWS, businesses can completely rebuild platforms to benefit from a robust \ninfrastructure, smooth scalability, rigorous compliance, and deep security expertise. The \nresult is a service where patients have a faster and better overall search experience.\n\n\n\nwhitepaper | Healthcare 3.0: The Doctor is Always In 4\n\nMoving toward connected care\n\nWhen connecting the healthcare experience across patients, payers, and providers, \nthe path from promise to practice is complex. Providers must identify the problem, \nstrategize the right solution, and then find the right partners. A cloud-based service like \nAWS provides comprehensive solutions that allow for scalability, flexibility, and cost-\neffectiveness. SoftServe works with clients to identify and support seamless integration \nand deployment in the healthcare industry. \n\nAs a certified member of the AWS Partner Network (APN), SoftServe can help clients \nautomate infrastructure provisions and management with the configuration management \ntools on AWS. With DevOps and Big Data competencies, SoftServe is available to help \ncustomers identify the most appropriate solutions when it comes to cost, performance, \nsecurity, and manageability. By conducting comprehensive evaluations and analysis of a \nclient\u2019s business and technical goals, SoftServe\u2019s familiarity with its clients\u2019 environments \nand challenges places it in a unique position to identify the correct solutions, guaranteeing \na better experience for all. \n\nAmazon Web Services (AWS) and SoftServe:\nAccelerate advances in healthcare\n\nAmazon Web Services focuses on helping healthcare providers deliver efficient, quality \ncare to patients by reducing the time needed to run existing workloads and by providing \naccess to useful analytics capabilities. AWS offers a broad set of global cloud-based \nproducts including compute, storage, databases, analytics, networking, mobile, \ndeveloper tools, management tools, IoT, security and enterprise applications. These \nservices help organizations move faster, lower IT costs, and scale. AWS is trusted by the \nlargest enterprises and most innovative start-ups across the healthcare sector to power \na wide variety of workloads including: web and mobile applications, data processing and \nwarehousing, storage, archive, and many others. AWS prioritizes the task of meeting all \nsecurity and privacy requirements, and eases information security by managing over \n1800 security controls. \n\nSoftServe Inc., a leading global digital implementation expert and consulting company, \ndelivers innovative solutions that leverage the power of the cloud on behalf of numerous \nhealthcare organizations. SoftServe has achieved Amazon Web Services DevOps \nCompetency status, recognizing Softserve\u2019s deep experience with AWS processes. \nAchieving the AWS DevOps Competency differentiates SoftServe as a member of the \nAWS Partner Network, demonstrating technical proficiency and proven customer success \nin continuous integration and delivery, monitoring, logging and performance. To receive \nthis designation, APN Partners must possess deep AWS expertise and deliver solutions \nseamlessly on AWS.\n\nhttps://aws.amazon.com/products/compute/\nhttps://aws.amazon.com/products/storage/\nhttps://aws.amazon.com/products/databases/\nhttps://aws.amazon.com/products/analytics/\nhttps://aws.amazon.com/products/networking/\nhttps://aws.amazon.com/mobile/\nhttps://aws.amazon.com/products/developer-tools/\nhttps://aws.amazon.com/products/management-tools/\nhttps://aws.amazon.com/iot/\nhttp://aws.amazon.com/compliance/hipaa-compliance\nhttps://aws.amazon.com/devops/partner-solutions/\nhttps://aws.amazon.com/devops/partner-solutions/\n\n\nABOUT US\nSoftServe is a digital authority that advises and provides at the cutting-\nedge of technology.

Portions \nof the platform have to commu-\n\nnicate with on-prem devices and software. \nThe main part of the solution leveraged a \nKubernetes cluster semi-manually deployed \ninto AWS using a mix of an open-source tool \nand Terraform configurations. The business \nhas strict reliability requirements that blocked \nthe possibility of updating the cluster version \nand its core components in runtime. There \nwas significant risk of losing the cluster \nbecause of an update failure, and together \nwith other limitations, was impeding desired \ninfrastructure improvements. At the time \nthe project with SoftServe began, our client \nhad lost most of its associates who had \ndeep knowledge on the infrastructure his- \ntory, architectural drivers, and decisions \nmade. Outdated infrastructure components \nand architectural imperfections caused pro- \nduction incidents that involved specific de- \nvelopment teams to address.\n\nFurthermore, the Chef orchestration tool \nwas used to provision new instances, including \nKubernetes instances. Its configuration had \ncritical issues that caused the launch of new \nnodes to be successful only half the time. \n\nAdditionally, regarding the infrastructure, a \ncustom CI/CD solution was created. The CI \nsolution imposed significant restrictions on \napplication delivery, making unusual CI use \ncases nearly impossible to implement. The CI \ntool, despite its good quality, prevented devel-\nopers from gaining actual knowledge about \nDocker, Kubernetes, and related open-source \ntools. To meet the growing internal devel-\nopment and business needs, our client needed \nto update the Kubernetes cluster deployment \narchitecture and prepare a flexible CI/CD so- \nlution that meet current industry standards.\n\ncase study |   Custom CI/CD Solution Deployed on AWS Helps Meal Delivery Service Transform \n     Microservices Architecture\n\n2\n\n\n\nMain VPC\n\nAccount, region\n\nAvailability zones A-Z\n\nAutoscaling groups\n\nPrivate subnet\n\u201cUtility\u201d\n\nMaster nodes\n\nPublic subnet\n\nLoad balancers Shared services\n\nPrivate subnet \"Team A\"\n\nShared servicesWorker nodes\n\nPrivate subnet\n\u201cTeam Z\u201d\n\nShared servicesWorker nodes\n\nPrivate subnet\n\u201cTeam B\u201d\n\nShared servicesWorker nodes\n\nProject Description\n\nT he project included several parts. \nSome were extracted into separate \nprojects, such as improvements in the \n\nlogging system, which could be done in \nearlier stages than other larger planned \narchitecture changes. The proposed solution \nincluded improvements in several areas.\n\nThe first and most important part was \nthe networking architecture change. Two \nadditional network segments with similar \nsettings were prepared in the production \nenvironment for future Kubernetes instal-\nlations to make future migrations between \ndifferent cluster configurations smoother \nand safer. This change made it possible to\n\ndo architectural experiments in production \nwithout the risk of affecting all users at \nonce. This was done not only to update \nthe Kubernetes cluster version, but also to \nperform significant changes to any internal \ncomponents without interrupting all running \napplications at once.\n\nSecondly, the cloud-based Kubernetes ser- \nvice AWS EKS was chosen for future use. \nThe decision shifted the responsibility of \nmaintaining the cluster\u2019s core components to \nthe cloud provider. This change also brought \nanother networking extension in Kubernetes, \nwhich was deeply integrated with AWS VPC, \nimproving the overall networking performance. \n\ncase study |   Custom CI/CD Solution Deployed on AWS Helps Meal Delivery Service Transform \n     Microservices Architecture\n\n3\n\n\n\nThirdly, all the configurations of the EKS \ninstallation were reflected in code, which \nincluded a combination of Terraform config- \nurations, CI/CD jobs, and Kubernetes re- \nsources in the form of Helm charts or plain \nYAML configurations, stored under a source-\ncontrol repository. This guaranteed trans-\nparency, disaster-recovery opportunities, \nand eliminated worry of any accidental infra-\nstructure or cluster component changes in \nany environment, including production.\n\nAdditionally, a new role-based authenti-\ncation was configured based on a combi-\nnation of an existing SAML-provider with \nIAM roles and Kubernetes RBAC settings \nwhich increased the overall security of the \ncluster.\n\nAnother noteworthy improvement was the \nuse of a different load balancing method. \nThe Traefik Ingress Controller from the \nprevious cluster was replaced with an ALB \nIngress Controller in the new setup. Since \nthe ALB Ingress Controller stays beyond the \ncluster itself, this step improved the overall \nreliability and network performance.\n\nOne of the principal requirements was \nto support gRPC communication between \nservices. To make the communication stable \nand transparent, a service mesh component, \nLinkerd, was used in the previous Kubernetes \ninstallation. The new cluster setup also \nincluded Linkerd, but it was updated to the  \nsecond generation, which is significantly \ndifferent from the first version\u2014it requires \nchanges to the deployment process and  \nincluded several new features and improve- \nments.\n\nThe next key change was to replace the \nlegacy CI tool with a new multifunctional \nsolution based on top of Helm and Jenkins \n\nfeatures. Helm is a popular package manager \nfor Kubernetes and unlike many third-party \noffered packages allows for the creation \nof custom packages using a well-known \nstandardized method. Jenkins is an old, but \npowerful automation server. A custom CI  \nlibrary was developed to make the new CI \nsolution extremely flexible, transparent, re- \npeatable, and scalable. The primary idea  \naround this CI version is \u201cconventions against \nrestrictions\u201d which allows developer teams to  \nimplement unusual CI/CD pipelines without \nwaiting for DevOps team members to be- \ncome available. Also, the solution makes \npossible the evolutionary development of \nCI/CD without the mandatory updating of all \nmicroservices when any new changes were \nintroduced into the primary libraries.\n\nThe Kubernetes node bootstrapping process \nwas improved. The Chef orchestration tool  \nis still used to install complimentary utilities, \nimprove monitoring, and add other tools \nto an instance. However, any configuration  \nerrors no longer block the instance from \nbeing added to the cluster and start \nprocessing its payload. This change consid-\nerably reduced the time required to add \nnew instances to Kubernetes clusters.\n\ncase study |   Custom CI/CD Solution Deployed on AWS Helps Meal Delivery Service Transform \n     Microservices Architecture\n\n4\n\n\n\nMigration\n\nE ach complex system has its history,  \nand revolutionary changes can do  \nthese a disservice; not only because  \n\nit\u2019s undesirable to interrupt production ser- \nvices under load, but because people have \nlimited bandwidth. Spreading knowledge \nacross a company requires time, patience, \nand effort. Some relationships between \napplications aren\u2019t visible until they break \nand sometimes code has issues and does \nnot meet modern requirements, therefore \nit\u2019s not always easy to move into a new \nenvironment. Migrations take significantly \nlonger time and include thousands of details \nto track. This project was no exception. \n\nAround 150 separate micro-services were \nthoroughly analyzed, prepared, and convert- \ned into the new CI. The final migration into \nthe new production environment required \nclose control over all cross-dependencies, \nsplitting all services into separate groups \nbased on their public or private relationships \n(Strangler pattern). Every unexpected ob- \nstacle was analyzed, discussed with teams, \n and eventually overcome thanks to constant \nand close cooperation with developers and  \nmanagement. This made it possible to solve  \nproblems that required attention in com- \npletely different directions.\n\nMain VPC\n\nAccount, region\n\nAvailability zones A-Z\n\nAutoscaling groupsEKS\n\nPrivate subnet\n\nShared services\n\nPrivate subnet\n\u201cTeam A\u201d\n\nShared services\n\nPrivate subnet\n\u201cTeam B\u201d\n\nShared services\n\nPrivate subnet\n\u201cTeam C\u201d\n\nShared services\n\nMain VPC\n\nAvailability zones A-Z\n\nPrivate subnet Private subnet\n\nWorker nodesLoad balancers\n\nAutoscaling groupsEKS\n\nMain VPC\n\nAvailability zones A-Z\n\nPrivate subnet Private subnet\n\nWorker nodesLoad balancers\n\nReplacement cluster,\nOn-demand\n\ncase study |   Custom CI/CD Solution Deployed on AWS Helps Meal Delivery Service Transform \n     Microservices Architecture\n\n5\n\n\n\nValue Delivered\n\nD espite the \u2018expected surprises\u2019 that \nappeared during project implemen-\ntation, the new environment was built \n\nand installed and the new CI replaced the \nlegacy CI for all Kubernetes-based projects. \nOur client\u2019s teams gained the knowledge \nrequired to use the system effectively. The \nupdated cluster contains a cutting-edge ar- \nchitectural stack, it \u2019s upgradable, reliable,  \nrequires less effort to maintain, and is trans-\nparent in any single trait, plus the vast major- \nity of its configuration is controlled via code \nunder Git. The number of worker nodes in \nthe cluster was cut in half. EC2 instances \nwere replaced with their modern gener-\nation and reserved upfront to reduce costs. \nEach worker node now has better resource \nutilization.\n\nThe migration was completed under load in \nreal-time with minimal requests interruption. \nThe newer recipes for Chef (orchestration \nframework) are no longer crucial to the oper-\nation of the cluster and can be replaced with \nany other framework when necessary. Addi-\ntionally, the secret storage has been unbound \nand can also be replaced when appropriate. \nThe solution is extremely flexible and de-\nsigned to meet future expectations.\n\nLessons Learned\n\nN o matter how thoroughly research \nwas conducted, new findings are \nguaranteed to be discovered at the \n\nimplementation stage. This means that \nefforts put into planning are important by \ndefinition, but proper testing is required. \nSmall changes should be delivered as soon \nas possible when they are ready, but big \nchanges must stand for a while on stage to \nbe proven. Migrations cannot be controlled \ncompletely unless all of the available re- \nsources are applied to achieve the goal. \nSince migrations are not something that \nbusiness need to focus on, there will always \nbe external factors that block some of the \nstages and increase the time. Continuous \ncontrol and efforts allow what was started \nto be completed to clear a path for new \naspirations and ideas.\n\ncase study |   Custom CI/CD Solution Deployed on AWS Helps Meal Delivery Service Transform \n     Microservices Architecture\n\n6\n\n\n\nABOUT US\nSoftServe is a digital authority that advises and provides at the \ncutting-edge of technology.

Far too many \n\ncompanies are stuck in an even-keel mode \nnot wanting to \u201crock the boat\u201d, unaware \nof the benefits of modernization, or most \noften\u2014they lack the manpower, tools, or \nexpertise to take effective transformational \naction.\n\nWhile many organizations take action due to \nbusiness challenge pains like waste, missed \nopportunity, or competitive lag\u2014sometimes \na business that is already doing well simply \nwants to do better.\n\nMcCoy\u2019s Building Supply is one of those \ncompanies unwilling to rest on its laurels.\n\nFounded in 1927, McCoy\u2019s is a fourth-genera-\ntion, family-owned supplier of lumber, build-\ning supplies and farm and ranch equipment. \nThe company provides a complete array of \nservices to its customer base including con-\nsumers, builders, contractors, repair/remod-\nelers, and farm and ranch folks. The San Mar-\ncos, Texas-based retailer is one of the largest \nfamily owned businesses in the building sup-\nplies industry.\n\nWe spoke with Ray Gabriel\u2014Director of IT \nInfrastructure at McCoy\u2019s\u2014to learn the com-\npany\u2019s motivations for adopting machine \nlearning (ML) for demand prediction.\n\nFor those unfamiliar with \nyour brand, please tell us \n\nabout McCoy's, your business \ngoals, and the challenges that \nML is helping to solve?\n \nRG: McCoy\u2019s is a family owned build-\ning material retail business that is \nover 90 years old. We operate in five \nstates: Texas, New Mexico, Oklaho-\nma, Arkansas, and Mississippi. We \nhave 88 retail units, 2 Door man-\nufacturing facilities, and distribu-\ntion sites.\n\nOur goal is to use machine learn-\ning to help us control our invento-\nry levels and cash flow more effec-\ntively. We want the ML model(s) to \nhelp us predict optimal inventory \nlevels for our major product cate-\ngories, while not tying up cash and \nfloor space.\n\n\n\nWhitepaper ML for Demand Prediction 3\n\nGood enough is never good enough.\n\nMcCoy's continually invests in its information \ntechnology as a differentiating factor for the \nbusiness, and for its customers. As part of this \neffort, McCoy\u2019s identified a potential way to \nuse emerging ML technology to improve how \nthe company forecasts inventory demand at \nstore locations. \n\nThe hypothesis was that a demand predic-\ntion approach leveraging Amazon Web Ser-\nvice (AWS) machine learning (ML) modeling \nservices could further optimize the process \nfor buying inventory and having it stocked at \nthe right store, at the right time.\n\nEven best laid plans don\u2019t always work out \nas intended the first time. Fortunately, the \nconversation and collaboration between \nMcCoy\u2019s and AWS continued\u2014thanks in no \nsmall part to Amazon\u2019s success in using its \nown AI/ML and solutions for serving its global \ncustomers as intelligently and cost effectively \nas possible.\n\nW hat attracted you to AWS \nfor this project? \n\n \nRG: Our previous experience with \nAWS came with a POC to move our \nData Warehouse to AWS.  We ran \ninto latency issues while moving \nlarge amounts of data daily. It did \nnot make sense to make that shift. \nBut although we did not move for-\nward with that POC, we were still \nintrigued as to how AWS could help us \nleverage some process efficiencies. \n\n\n\nWhitepaper ML for Demand Prediction 4\n\nA s an Austin, Texas-based, AWS Premier \nConsulting Partner with numerous \n\ncompetencies and an AWS Ambassador on \nit global team, SoftServe\u2019s ML/Data Science \nteam was brought in to deliver strategy and \nimplementation of the project. \n\nBy leveraging an AWS demand prediction \nmodel, McCoy\u2019s can now better:\n\n\u2022 Free up previously locked capital\n\n\u2022 Reduce excess inventory\n\n\u2022 Lessen product shrink \n\n\u2026and can reduce out of stock scenarios to \nimprove sales performance.\n\nW hat made you decide on AWS machine learning services\u2014like \nAmazon Forecast\u2014to improve your retail solution and achieve \n\nyour goals?\n\n \nRG: It is evident that Amazon does a great job in managing their own inventory; so, \nwe assume their success is being leveraged by their own ML services and forecast-\ning tools.  With this in mind, it makes sense to take advantage of the data structure \nand modeling that Amazon has proven out and will continue to improve on.\n\n\n\nWhitepaper ML for Demand Prediction 5\n\nHow long have you been \nworking with SoftServe \n\nand what has been your \nexperience? \n \nRG: We have been working with \nSoftServe for well over a year.  We \nappreciate their approach on pro-\nviding solutions for business-criti-\ncal operations. Their step by step \nprocess, ability to collaborate with \nus, and their external knowledge \nsources is what led us to partner \nwith them.\n\nSoftServe\u2019s Intelligent Enterprise COE \nteams, including experts in Big Data & \n\nAnalytics, Experience Design, Cloud, Busi-\nness Analysis, and AI/ML\u2014as well as an APN \nAmbassador\u2014collaboratively enable compa-\nnies to become truly data driven, and not just \ndata aware.\n\nIn addition to predictive forecasting models, \nthese cross-matrix teams deliver transfor-\nmational solutions like Actionable Insights \nEcosystems, Enterprise Data Platform, Big \nData Cloud Migration, and Intelligent Auto-\nmation\u2014powered by AWS.\n\n\n\nWhitepaper ML for Demand Prediction 6\n\nLet\u2019s talk about your machine learning journey and how AWS and SoftServe can deliver pre-\ndictive, actionable insights for improved efficiency and profitability at scale.\n\nBefore we go, is there anything else you would like to share \nabout SoftServe\u2019s performance with solution design and \n\nimplementation?\n\n \nRG: SoftServe listened to our needs and took into account our current capacity and \nhow we would like to utilize our data more effectively. They provided more than one \napproach to the challenge, while giving candid opinions on each solution.

This \nwas the case with our client\u2014a US-based \nhealthcare company that provides kidney \ndialysis services\u2014that was seeking a more \nreliable and cost-effective alternative \napplication hosting platform solution. \nAdditionally, this company had been \nseeking another vendor as the previous \nagreement was expiring.\n\nOur client received a security-focused, consistent foundation to deliver  \napplications anywhere, with full-stack automated operations and streamlined \ndeveloper workflows. \n\nOur client approached Google to consult \non the available solutions. It was at this \nmoment that Google recommended to \npartner with SoftServe to address this \nneed by delivering Anthos for optimization, \nautomation, and application modernization. \nIn 2020, SoftServe achieved the Anthos: \nHybrid/Multi-Cloud App Platform Expertise \nas part of the Google Cloud Partner \nAdvantage Program. This expertise affirms \nthat SoftServe has the experience and \ntechnical acumen to accelerate a client\u2019s \nenterprise digital journey by modernizing \nexisting applications and building cloud-\nnative applications with Anthos. With a \ndedicated team of Anthos trained and \nsolutions-ready engineers serving the US \nand EMEA, SoftServe has an extensive \nhistory with Istios and 25+ projects \ndelivered to date.  \n\ncase study |    Anthos & Automation for Healthcare 2\n\n\n\nOur experts faced a challenge in providing a managing solution for the traditional \nworkloads as well as modern GPU-based workload used by the client\u2019s data science team in \non-premises data centers and enabling smart usage of GPU workloads in the new solution. \n\nSoftServe\u2019s approach had multiple phases.  \n\nThe first step was a discovery phase where SoftServe\u2019s expert needed to assess the client\u2019s \ncurrent infrastructure and provide technical advisory services for the future solution. The \nexisting infrastructure was built in Docker, which influenced the increase in the client\u2019s \noperational expenses. After careful deliberation, our team proposed the usage of Google \nAnthos to incorporate both an on-premise and cloud environments. After the requirements \nanalysis and evaluation, SoftServe built a well-thought-out implementation strategy. \n\n\u2022 Configured Anthos and started the \napplication migration from Docker \nthat resulted in significant reduction of \noperational expenses. \n\n\u2022 Optimized graphic processing units \n(GPUs) \n\n\u2022 Workload management\u2014compared to \non-premises GPUs used by client\u2019s data \nscience team. This reduced costs for \nML-based workloads and boosted the \nspeed of new projects onboarding.  \n\n\u2022 Integrated a unified management and \ndeployment CD (Continuous Delivery) \nprocess with the GitOps approach to \nmake sure the workloads correctly \nmigrate between environments. This \nresulted in increased productivity, \nenhanced developer experience, and \nstronger security guarantees. \n\n\u2022 Implemented a multi-datacenter global \nload balancing system based on Citrix \nADC and Citrix in REST controllers that \nimproved stability and reliability in \nmodernizing the application. \n\n\u2022 Set up a liable and robust monitoring \nand alerting system to provide \nmanagement and control of the entire \ninfrastructure. Improved incident \nmanagement. This helped reduce time-\nto-response on incidents, improved the \nend-user experience, allowed for more \nproactive response to changes, and \noptimized costs to increase ROI.\n\nNot only did SoftServe\u2019s team configure and set up Anthos, but we also developed an \ninnovative solution to automatically manage the GPU workloads in the datacenters. \nSince Anthos didn\u2019t have a solution for this challenge and wasn\u2019t yet compatible with GPU \nworkloads, and the process of managing these workloads was entirely manual, our experts \ncreated their own innovative solution. The team implemented automated integration \nof Athos with GPUs on VMware, which provides full control and management of the \nworkloads.\n\nDuring the implementation phase, our team:\n\ncase study |    Anthos & Automation for Healthcare 3\n\n\n\nDevelopment: \n\n\u2022 Python \n\n\u2022 GoLang \n\n\u2022 Operator SDK \n\n \n\nInfrastructure: \n\n\u2022 Citrix \n\n\u2022 Anthos \n\n\u2022 ELK \n\n\u2022 VmWare \n\n\u2022 ROS \n\nTool set: \n\n\u2022 Jenkins \n\n\u2022 FluxCD \n\n\u2022 Helm \n\n\u2022 Terraform \n\n \nTool set: \n\n\u2022 OPA \n\n\u2022 Gatekeeper \n\nBy partnering with Google and SoftServe, the client was able to: \n\n\u2022 Receive a security-focused and consistent foundation to deliver applications anywhere, \nwith full-stack automated operations and streamlined developer workflows. \n\n\u2022 Establish a simplified onboarding process for all new applications, reduced operating \nexpenses, and increased developer productivity.  \n\n\u2022 Get a significantly improved Anthos setup that fostered the product\u2019s resilience, \nreliability, security, and flexibility. \n\nLet\u2019s talk about how SoftServe can increase security, reliability, and flexibility of your \napplications with Anthos optimization and automation.\n\nTECH STACK \n\ncase study |    Anthos & Automation for Healthcare 4\n\nhttps://www.softserveinc.com/en-us/contact\n\n\nABOUT US\n\nWe are advisors, engineers, and designers who deliver innovation, quality, \nand speed\u2014elevating and accelerating our clients\u2019 digital journeys.\n\nOur approach is built on a foundation of empathetic, human-focused \nexperience design that ensures value and continuity from concept to \nrelease.\n\nWE IDENTIFY WHERE YOU ARE.\nWE PREPARE YOU FOR THE ROAD AHEAD. \nWE TAKE YOU WHERE YOU NEED TO GO.\nVisit our website, blog, LinkedIn, Facebook, and Twitter pages.\n\nNORTH AMERICAN HQ\n\n201 W 5th Street, Suite 1550 \nAustin, TX 78701\n\nUSA +1 866 687 3588 (USA) +1 647 \n948 7638 (Canada)\n\nEUROPEAN HQ\n\n14 New Street London EC2M 4HE \nUnited Kingdom\n\nLevel 39, One Canada Square\n\nCanary Wharf, London E14 5AB \nUnited Kingdom\n+44 (0) 800 302 9436\n\ninfo@softserveinc.com \nwww.softserveinc.com\n\nhttps://www.softserveinc.com/en-us\nhttps://www.softserveinc.com/en-us/blog\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/company/softserve/\nhttps://www.facebook.com/SoftServeInc\nhttps://twitter.com/SoftServeInc\n\n", "LocationURL": "https://www.softserveinc.com/files/cases/anthos-and-automation-for-healthcare.pdf", "id": "sw-rf-794", "FileName": "anthos-and-automation-for-healthcare.pdf", "Storage": "SoftServe Website", "Published": "2021-09-21T11:31:56Z", "FileType": ".pdf"}, {"Category": null, "content": "\nDigital\nStrategies for\nFuture-Proofing\nYour Business in\n\n\n\nIn today\u2019s competitive business environment, \nenterprise leaders are under constant pressure \nto innovate, overcome technology challenges, \nand adapt to rapidly changing market conditions. \nThey are also responsible for anticipating \ntheir organization\u2019s future needs and building \nsolutions that enable long-term growth, or \n\u201cfuture-proofing.\u201d \n\nSuccessful future-proofing initiatives break \ndown traditional communication silos and give \nway to a more modern, agile enterprise \u2013 one \nthat can compete with industry disrupters \nnot shackled by traditional business models \nor corporate bureaucracy. Future-proofing \nshould not be an afterthought, but a strategic \nconsideration in any purchasing decision that \ninvolves a significant digital investment. \n\nOf course, no organization can completely \nprotect itself against change and innovation. \n\nThere\u2019s also no single miracle pill or one-size-\nfits-all-solution that will address the unique \nneeds of every company. As we explore future-\nproofing, we\u2019re aiming to build a foundation \nthat minimizes replacement and maintenance \ncosts, reduces long-term risk, and makes \nit as easy as possible to offer exceptional \nproducts or services that can evolve with the \nmarketplace.    \n\nIn the following guide, we explore three key, \ninterconnected concepts that can act as the \nbasis for future-proofing initiatives at any \nenterprise organization: digital infrastructure, \ncustomer experience, and employee satisfaction. \nThough each business leader will have his or \nher unique priorities, and there are many more \nfactors that contribute to an organization\u2019s \nlong-term health, these are three areas where \nthoughtful digital investments can yield \nincredible results.\n\n2\n\n\n\nDigital Infrastructure\n\nCustomer Experience\n\nEmployee Satisfaction\n\n3\n\n\n\n4\n\nDIGITAL INFRASTRUCTURE\n\nMost enterprise organizations still run on \n\u201clegacy\u201d infrastructure involving software, \napplications, and languages that are \nyears \u2013 if not decades \u2013 old. According to \nInformationweek, 70% of business transactions \nare still processed in COBOL, a language \ndesigned in 1959 and patched in 2002.\n\nBut the startups and services responsible for \ndigital disruption are typically working with \nnew and more advanced technology. Investing \nin modern digital infrastructure should be \na priority for any enterprise that wishes to \nremain competitive today and continue to \nevolve in the future.\n\nof business transactions are \nstill processed in COBOL,\na language designed\nin 1959 and patched in 2002\n\nSource: Informationweek\n\nhttp://www.informationweek.com/government/leadership/breaking-the-cycle-of-legacy-it-investment-/d/d-id/1114106\nhttp://www.informationweek.com/government/leadership/breaking-the-cycle-of-legacy-it-investment-/d/d-id/1114106\n\n\n5\n\nStrategy Before Tactics\n\nIt\u2019s been said this year\u2019s IT investment\nbecomes next year\u2019s maintenance expense,\nand while that is technically true, it is also \npossible to reduce maintenance costs \nwith careful planning. Likewise, most of us \nwould prefer a maintenance expense over a \nreplacement expense \u2013 strategic choices can \nreduce the need for complete overhauls. \n\nToday\u2019s digital ecosystem consists of an \nunprecedented and constantly increasing \nnumber of tools, solutions, and best practices. \nAd hoc implementations can provide a quick \nfix to tactical problems, but often lead to \ntechnological complications, limited benefits, \nand business complexity, which ultimately \nhinder long-term success. \n\nTo maximize the value of modern technology, \nit\u2019s important to build a technology stack \nthat exhibits several key attributes, \nincluding scalability, security, configurability, \ninteroperability, reliability, and extensibility. \nWhile these all play an important part in the \nselection process, two attributes are essential \nconsideration for future-proofing, scalability \nand security.\n\n\n\n6\n\nWhat is scalability and why is it important?\n\nThe \u201ctextbook\u201d definition of scalability is the \nability of an IT system to maintain a specified level \nof performance as the workload on the system \nincreases. So, in essence, scalability is what \nenables a technology system to meet growing \ndemands without sacrificing performance. \n\nThe workload on an IT system can grow for a \nvariety of reasons, including:\n \n\u2022\t an increase in the number of individuals \n\nwho access and use the system, \n\n\u2022\t an increase in the number of operations or \n\u201crequests\u201d the system processes, \n\n\u2022\t an increase in the complexity of the \noperations the system processes.\n\n \n\nScalable infrastructure won\u2019t require frequent \nupdates or changes and has the capacity \nto meet an organization\u2019s needs for the \nforeseeable future.  \n\nBecause scalable infrastructure has the \nflexibility to accommodate an enterprise\u2019s \nfuture needs, it mitigates the risks associated \nwith acquiring and implementing a new solution \nand protects the organization\u2019s investment.\n\n\n\n7\n\nScalability and the Cloud\n\nScalability often goes hand-in-hand with Cloud \ntechnology. The benefits of Cloud solutions \ninclude decreased time-to-market, reduced \ncosts, improved efficiency, and an increase in \nagility. Cloud offers the potential to transform \nthe design, development, and deployment of \nnext-generation technologies and represents\na new way to architect digital solutions. \n\nIronically, most hesitation regarding Cloud \nadoption is rooted in misconceptions \nsurrounding Cloud security and an enterprise\u2019s \nability to protect critical data.\n\nSecurity is the second essential consideration \nfor future-proofing an organization\u2019s digital \ninfrastructure, but it\u2019s important to note\nthat the Cloud is not inherently less safe\nthan an on-premises or hosted solution or \nmore prone to attack. In fact, the Cloud is \narguably more secure than the alternative. \n\nInformation Age editor Ben Rossi writes, \n\u201c\u2026both do as good a job as they can to \nprotect from attacks. But in terms of human \nrisk, which is often the most damaging of \nall, employees with potentially malevolent \nintentions will find it more difficult to locate \ncertain data in the Cloud.\u201d\n\nhttp://www.information-age.com/great-it-myth-cloud-really-less-secure-premise-123459135/\n\n\n8\n\nHow does security enable future success?\n\nEnterprise organizations are now responsible \nfor vast and growing amounts of data that are \nproprietary or confidential and highly valuable, \nboth to the organization itself and potentially \nto malicious third parties. At the same time, the \nnumber of employees who need access to this \ndata is larger than ever before, and the access \nneeds of users often vary significantly, even \nwithin departments. \n\nThe consequences of flawed or inadequate \nsecurity can be significant; just ask the \nexecutives at countless enterprise organizations \nthat have faced data breaches over the last \nseveral years.\n\nNot only can businesses experience\nshort-term revenue loss coupled with unexpected \ncosts related to damage control, the long-term \nramifications to public perception can be \ncatastrophic to an organization\u2019s health. \n\nFor this reason, when changing or developing \nany piece of their digital infrastructure, \nbusiness leaders must understand what \nsecurity capabilities are needed and how \neach prospective solution addresses those \ncapabilities. Typically those capabilities fall \nunder three core dimensions known as the \n\u201cCIA Triad.\u201d\n\nhttp://www.informationisbeautiful.net/visualizations/worlds-biggest-data-breaches-hacks/\n\n\n9\n\nUnderstanding the CIA Triad\n\nThere are three core dimensions of information \nsecurity: confidentiality, integrity, and \navailability. Security professionals refer to these \nthree essential elements as the \u201cCIA Triad,\u201d and \nluckily all three are relatively easy concepts to \nmaster or at least understand.\n\n\u2022\t In the information security context, \nconfidentiality means that only authorized \nindividuals or systems can access specific \ndata on a \u201cneed to know\u201d basis. \n\n\u2022\t Integrity refers to the accuracy of all or \nsome information and the prevention of \nunauthorized modification of data or other \nsystem components. The primary mechanisms \nfor protecting both confidentiality and integrity \nare user access controls and data encryption.\n\n\u2022\t Availability means an information system \nand the data it contains are readily \naccessible to authorized users. Systems and \ndata can become unavailable because of \naccidental occurrences (natural disasters, \npower outages, etc.) or intentional attacks. \n\nAttacks that specifically target availability \nare known as denial of service attacks. \nMaintaining availability is typically more \ncomplex than integrity or confidentiality and \nrequires a wider variety of strategies. \n\nFor example, using redundant hardware \ncomponents and having an effective disaster \nrecovery plan can minimize the effects of \nhardware failures and natural disasters. The \nprimary mechanisms for dealing with denial of \nservice attacks typically include a combination \nof detection, diagnosis, and remediation.\n\n\n\n10\n\nCUSTOMER EXPERIENCE\n\nIt\u2019s been more than 10 years since Don Peppers \nand Martha Rogers declared the customer \nexperience the single most important factor for \nbusiness success in Return on Customer. \n\nAnd yet, many leading enterprise organizations \nstill struggle to prioritize the customer \nexperience or confuse it with customer \nmarketing \u2014 that is, the communications and \npromotional activities used to attract and \nretain customers.\n\nThe truth is, marketing activities represent \nonly a fraction of the interactions that exist a \nbetween company and its customer. Perhaps \nmore importantly, what an organization says in \nits advertising has far less impact on customer \nperception than what it does in reality.\n\nThe customer experience is the sum of all \ninteractions a customer has with a company. \nLike digital infrastructure, investing in\na memorable customer experience now\ncan instill the sort of loyalty that will\nensure an organization\u2019s future success.\nThis is why we consider it a key consideration \nfor future-proofing. \n\nThe first step toward improving the customer \nexperience is building a successful customer \nexperience strategy that combines an \norganization\u2019s unique brand identity with \nresearch, analytics, and careful planning.\n\n\n\n11\n\nBuilding a Digital Experience Strategy\n\nBrand Identity\n\nDelivering on the brand promise, expressing \nthe brand personality, and bringing the brand \nattributes to life should be top priorities when \ndesigning the customer experience.\n\nFirst, an enterprise and/or its partners must \ndefine or reaffirm the overarching ideas that \nrepresent the brand. REI\u2019s brand platform is \ninfused with the excitement and adventure \nof the outdoors; Chick-fil-A\u2019s is exceeding \ncustomers\u2019 expectations through service with \na servant\u2019s spirit.\n\nSegmentation\n\nThe next step is to break down customers \ninto unique personas. Different target segments \nhave different needs so their desired experiences \nwill also vary.\n\nMost organizations will begin with demographics, \nbut it\u2019s also a good idea to consider other \nfactors that can influence brand perception \u2014 \nsome customers may value convenience over \nprice, for example. Others want to do business \nwith an organization they relate to or that \nprovides a source of entertainment.\n\nPersona mapping requires an organization to \ndescribe each segment with a common profile, \nkey drivers for their purchase decisions, and an \nunderstanding for each group\u2019s unique needs \nfrom an experience perspective. \n\n\n\n12\n\nExperience Design\n\nOnce an organization has defined its brand \nidentity and researched its customers\u2019 values, \nit can begin determining how to meet the \nsegment-specific needs of each group, either by \nimproving existing approaches or by developing \nentirely new experiences. \n\nThese needs are often uncovered using \nadvanced, quantitative data analytics in \nconjunction with qualitative customer \ninterviews. All the factors that make up the \ndigital customer experience \u2014 including \nproduct, service, content, channels, pricing, \nand platforms \u2014 should be considered and \naddressed as part of the design. \n\nBuilding compelling customer experiences \nrequires business leaders to break down \ntraditional silos and alter the perception of \nthe customer experience as solely a marketing \nresponsibility, but developing the process\nand strategies that contribute to a memorable \ncustomer experience is a competitive \nadvantage that can transcend price and\nensure an organization\u2019s future success for \nyears to come.\n\n\n\n13\n\nEMPLOYEE SATISFACTION\n\nFinally, employee satisfaction is a critical but \noften overlooked consideration for future-\nproofing within an organization, but as the \nworkforce continues to shrink, attracting and \nretaining the brightest and most productive \nworkers will become a top priority of every \nmajor enterprise. Of course, these workers will \nbe members of what is now referred to as the \nmillennial generation. \n\nContrary to popular belief, millennials are some \nof the most productive people around, but they \nare unique in that they pride themselves on \n\u201cworking smarter, not harder.\u201d And while much \nhas been said about the preferences tomorrow\u2019s \nworkforce, recruiting and retaining millennial \nworkers will take more than a ping pong table in \nthe breakroom or a keg in the kitchen. \n\nMillennials and subsequent generations will \nactively seek out tools that enable efficiency \nand increase productivity, and they will one \nday consider the digital experience provided \nby their employers as a factor in where they \ndecide to work. \n\nSuccessful organizations understand they must \nbegin investing in resources today that will \nsupport tomorrow\u2019s business leaders and that \nmore user-friendly tools will not only improve \nemployee satisfaction; in many cases, it will \nimprove the customer experience, as well.\n\n\n\n14\n\nThe Consumerization of Work\n\nIn the early 2000s, businesses were the primary \nusers of technology, so they naturally set the rules \nfor how technology should be built. The result was \nclunky, feature-rich software that no one apart \nfrom a few power users knew how to use.\n\nToday, almost everyone has the ability to \nbecome a power user, from the infant who \nunderstands the act of \u201cswiping\u201d on a tablet \nbut not flipping a page in a book to the \ngrandmother who posts social media updates \nfrom her phone. \n\nThe \u201cconsumerization\u201d of enterprise software \ntook off in 2014. Software companies catering \nto enterprise organizations began redefining \nthe user experience to make technology more \nclosely resemble consumer applications. \n\nImproved experiences have multiple benefits, \nfrom an increase in productivity to enabling \nand motivating employees to deliver a better \ncustomer experience. \n\nThis trend will continue as developers move \naway from a purely utilitarian approach toward \nthe creation of software that\u2019s more intuitive, \nmore user-friendly, and able to cater to users\u2019 \nchanging needs. \n\nMore importantly, enterprise business leaders \nwill no longer just consider these features in \nenterprise purchasing decisions; they will begin \nto apply these concepts to the entire digital \nexperience provided to their employees.\n\n\n\n15\n\nImproving the Digital Experience for Employees\n\nThere are multiple ways for enterprise business \nleaders to improve the digital experience, but \nthe following three trends are three of the \nmost popular ways to mimic current consumer \nexpectations and ensure future employees are \nsatisfied with tools provided to them to meet \nbusiness goals. \n\n1. Mobile Access\n\nMost jobs require teamwork, which is difficult \nfor a workforce that is becoming increasingly \nmore remote. At the same time, workers often \nfind themselves at events or with customers \nand unable to quickly connect to the resources \nthey need to work off-site.\n\nWhile many companies are making great \nstrides in intuitive and collaborative desktop \ntools, mobile tools still lag far behind. As \ntime goes on, more people are going to \nstart using their personal mobile devices as \nsupplementary \u2013 if not primary \u2013 work tools. \n\nThe most innovative business leaders will \ninvest in mobile applications that leverage\nreal-time data analytics and enable their \nemployees to work on-the-go. \n\n2. Streamlined Collaboration\n\nThe consumer world is seeing an explosion\nin popularity among sites such as Quora\nand Yelp, which allow users to benefit from \nsomeone else\u2019s experiences. Corporations\nare now recognizing the potential of similar \ntools for business, such as leveraging other \npeople\u2019s knowledge for customer support \nor employee training or a resource hub that \ncatalogs institutional expertise.\n\n\n\n16\n\nThe natural evolution of this collective \nknowledge will be for enterprises and the \nsoftware companies that cater to them to \ndevelop similar solutions that make knowledge \nsharing more efficient in a work environment. \n\n3. Frictionless UX/UI\n\nMost importantly, enterprise leaders need to \nfocus on developing tools that are intuitive, \nfast, and remove common bottlenecks. \n\nFor example, enterprise systems that \nemployees use are often quite different from \nthe systems built for customers. As a result, \ncustomer service centers suffer long wait \ntimes and customer service representatives \nare often unable to sync their applications with \nthe customer\u2019s interface, frustrating both the \nemployee and the customer. \n\nGone are the days of employees putting up \nwith unwieldy enterprise software.

More and more people \nevery year are embracing the idea of actively participating in their own health monitoring \nand management. This trend is revolutionizing healthcare ecosystems in the US and beyond. \nBut any ecosystem is only as good as its constituent companies and patient participants. \n\nToday, forward-thinking healthcare companies and medical management businesses \nare facing the same questions: How can I contribute to facilitating positive patient \nengagement, both physically and digitally? How will my company benefit from improved \npatient engagement? And, how do I eliminate the weak links in my ecosystem? \n\nFor many, the answers begin with more efficient use of the latest consumer-oriented \ntechnologies that create user-friendly experiences, attract more patients to engage with \nhealthcare ecosystems on a regular basis, and result in benefits for all members.\n\n!\n\nWhat do patients want\n\nPatients today want easy-to-use portals to make appointments and access their electronic \nhealth records and test results. They want predictive statistical analysis and risk scoring, \nbased on the data submitted from their wearables, smart devices, and home sensors.  \nThey want mobile doctor visits, efficient preventive care, and an overall streamlined \ntreatment process. By using technology to its full potential, healthcare and medical \nmanagement companies can make these expectations a reality. \n\nBut doing so does impose new demands on everyone. For example, to improve medication \nadherence and patient engagement, pharmacies can now use technology, including virtual \nassistants and smart pill boxes, to provide reminders and guarantee timely refills, as well \nas maximize medication synchronization.\n\nUsing patient-reported data from wearables and smart devices can now enable healthcare \ncompanies to engage with patients more effectively, and focus on developing and \nproviding precision medications for specific health conditions, by reflecting each individual \npatient\u2019s lifestyle, living environment, and even genes. \n\n\n\nwhitepaper | Are You the Weak Link in Patient Engagement? 3\n\nBenefits for every business\n\nPatients are certainly not the only ones standing to benefit from efficient engagement \nwith the healthcare ecosystem. Better patient engagement leads to improved medication \nadherence, which, in turn, leads to faster treatment outcomes and considerable savings for \nhospitals and other healthcare providers. According to a recent analysis published in the \nAnnals of Internal Medicine, non-adherence costs US healthcare providers from $100 to \n$289 billion each year, an estimated 10% of hospitalizations, and 125,000 deaths.\n\nOn a larger scale, patient health data aggregated across many geographic locations could \ncertainly be used to reveal wider patterns, offering rich opportunities for new healthcare \nresearch and treatment solutions.\n\nLooking ahead, the vision for patient engagement is promising and positive. That said \nthere are many \u201cweak links\u201d that healthcare providers, pharmacies, health insurance, and \nmedical management companies will need to resolve before turning this vision into reality, \nand bringing a seamless experience to fruition.   \n\nEngage with IT experience\n\nSoftServe is already working with healthcare and medical management companies to \nprovide technology solutions that help to enhance patient engagement.\n\nFor example,\n\n\u2022 We have leveraged machine learning and cognitive computing for multiple clients, \nenabling a more efficient and effective communication model.\n\n\u2022 We have built applications and restructured healthcare providers\u2019 portals to make \nthem more user-friendly.\n\n\u2022 We have helped to transform healthcare delivery through virtual reality, assistive \ntechnology, and voice technology.\n\nWe would be happy to engage with you.

For some,\nit\u2019s the latest way to create positive, memorable, and valuable interactions with customers.\n\nGamification disrupts traditional methods of customer engagement to make interactions\npositive, entertaining, and profitable. How? By providing motivation and driving desired\nbehavior through incentivizing customer activities and transactions.\n\nMany industries have incorporated gamification into customer engagement over the\nyears, from loyalty programs to quizzes, interactive video games, and augmented and\nvirtual reality experiences.\n\nFinancial applications turn savings into games where the \u201cplayer\u201d can convert game \nrewards into cash savings. Retailers use marketing quizzes and point systems to \nreward customers with prizes and gain important personalization insights. Media uses \ngamification as a way to make content interactive and engaging.\n\nHowever, one of the industries that stands to benefit the most is noticeably absent:\nhealthcare.\n\nThe opportunity to gamify healthcare is virtually limitless. Give patients incentives to \nadhere to treatment plans. Reward the chronically ill for healthy lifestyle choices, tracking\nimprovements. Drive advances in epidemiology and overall population health and \nwellness.\n\nGamification\u2014if healthcare companies embrace it\u2014stands to literally change the game.\n\nGood job, \nyou took \nyour pill \non time\n\n+ points5\n\nhttps://www.forbes.com/sites/tomaslaurinavicius/2017/12/05/startup-of-the-week-long-game/#521047614f72\nhttps://www.forbes.com/sites/tomaslaurinavicius/2017/12/05/startup-of-the-week-long-game/#521047614f72\nhttps://www.business2community.com/ecommerce/gamification-make-mobile-retail-web-apps-even-engaging-effective-01972022\nhttps://www.td.org/insights/does-gamification-actually-work-yes-and-heres-why\n\n\nwhitepaper | Get in the Game: Gamification in Healthcare 3\n\nGamification is wildly successful within the segment of health and fitness. It makes\nsense: most sports are fundamentally games themselves and provide competitive\nmotivation for health and fitness.\n\nTracking activities through IoT devices becomes an easy way to reward behavior, and a \nvariety of different businesses have been providing these apps for years. Smart watches \nequipped with Apple\u2019s suite of fitness apps, and the now infamous concept of \u201cclosing your \nrings,\u201d FitBit\u2019s 10,000 steps, MyFitnessPal\u2019s diet and activity tracker, and more provide a \nmeans for users to track movements as well as incentive to do more. \n\nLet\u2019s get motivated\n\nRegardless of efforts made by payers, providers, insurance agencies, and others, the \npatient ultimately has full autonomy over his care plan and how well he follows that course \nof care\u2014if he chooses to follow it at all. Care plans are always reliant on the patient: \nrefilling prescriptions, attending doctor appointments, getting regular exercise, conforming \nto diet restrictions, and more.\n\nWhen a patient takes his medicine, he reduces his risk of recurrence and increases his \nchance of recovery. When he follows his outpatient treatment guide or performs physical \ntherapy exercises on his own at home, he is more likely to recover fully. All of these \nactivities benefit the patient while realizing lower costs for providers.\n\nSo how can healthcare companies motivate patients to be active participants in their \ncare plans? \n\nMotivation is a core tenet of gamification. After all, it was designed to encourage the\nright behaviors from the user or consumer. In healthcare, gamification should be used to \nmotivate patients to invest in their own care, producing results for both themselves and \ntheir providers. Gamification therefore serves as the incentive: delivering motivation in a \nway that is seamless with the patient\u2019s daily life, easy to adopt\u2014and, dare we say, fun.\n\nWhile there are many tools currently available to monitor and encourage health, fitness, \nchronic disease, rehabilitation, and more, games power these tools with the promise of\na reward. That reward can take many forms: entertainment, monetary incentive, or pure \ncompetition. And in doing so, it increases the likelihood of improving individual health \noutcomes, gaining a better analysis of individual patients, augmenting personalization \nefforts, and lowering costs for healthcare businesses.\n\nWhat does gamification look like in action?\n\nOn your mark, get set, go!\n\nHealthcare leaders need to integrate better technologies to drive patient adherence and \nlower costs. Gamification is an intuitive way to drive both simultaneously, and the success \nof this approach is already on the books.\n\n\n\nwhitepaper | Get in the Game: Gamification in Healthcare 4\n\nSetting goals and tracking improvement is a key factor in the success of all of these \nprograms and their users' outcomes.\n\nTracking data doesn\u2019t need to be limited to movement either\u2014for example, weight on \na scale or a heartrate that is lowered over time are easily measured metrics to gauge \nprogress. It is when these metrics are paired with the right incentive (emotional, monetary \nreward, etc.) that we see motivation, and ultimately behavior change.\n\nGamified tracking can also be applied to chronic illnesses like diabetes. SoftServe \npartnered with Outcomes Based Healthcare to develop Sense360, an application that \nhelped patients with diabetes by monitoring phone use to detect changes in the condition. \n\nBut while it\u2019s easy to incentivize some with competition and beating personal goals, many\nneed more motivation. Motivation can be a roadblock on the way to better health for\nthose who don\u2019t exercise, are less motivated, or chronically ill, and even in rehabilitation.\n\nFor those companies unsure where to start gamification efforts, a first foray can be a\nmodification of an existing loyalty program. In this \u201cgame,\u201d patients are rewarded with\ndiscounts for following medication regimens, fulfilling certain activities, attending certain\ngyms, ordering healthy meals, and more. This format requires several components:\npartnership on the part of the healthcare business, regulatory compliance from the partner \nand the patient, and a reliable way of tracking activities, such as via IoT devices and GPS.\n\nThe game in this scenario can be a few different things: awarding those who track rewards\nthe most often, unlocking better monetary offers that map to more difficult activities, or\ncreating beacons at different partner locations to register check-ins during a scavenger\nhunt, for example.\n\nhttps://www.softserveinc.com/en-us/news/softserve-helps-obh-use-big-data-and-analytics/\n\n\nwhitepaper | Get in the Game: Gamification in Healthcare 5\n\nHealth insurer AIA Australia offers members the app AIA Vitality to cash in on a variety\nof rewards for healthy lifestyle choices. Activity-tracking IoT devices sync to AIA\u2019s app and \nmembers track their fitness progress, redeeming rewards when goals are met. Rewards \ninclude discounts for partnered gym memberships and cash vouchers that can be spent at \npartnered stores. For those motivated more by helping others, members also have the \noption to donate rewards to charities. With the latest iteration of the Vitality app, AIA \nAustralia experienced a 40% increase in core engagement over the past two years.\n\nLeveling up in Healthcare\n\nFor those who already employ gamificiation, or those who want to operate at the cutting \nedge, consider the next level: immersive experiences.\n\nImmersive experiences are creating a lot of excitement in the healthcare industry. \nAugmented and virtual reality (AR and VR) components integrate fitness games into \nreal life. By eliminating game controllers and screens, everyday movements seamlessly \ntransform into an immersive game that keeps patients active.\n\nTake the popular AR game of 2017, Pok\u00e9mon Go. Players use smartphones to explore \ntheir surroundings in order to collect different Pok\u00e9mon and accomplish different \nchallenges. One study found that the game increased the number of those who walked \nmore than 10,000 steps each day from 15% to 28%. Another study showed that playing \nraised moderate to vigorous physical activity by about 50 minutes per week and reduced \nsedentary behavior by 30 minutes a day. Imagine integrating this concept into a healthcare \napp to lower costs and boost patient activity.\n\nOutside the realm of fitness, AR and VR are already being applied to patients going through \nrehabilitation and recovery, using motivating scenarios to stretch abilities. Patients within \nthis segment include those with disabilities, those relearning motor functions, recovering \nfrom surgery, or simply undertaking preventative maintenance. Patients immerse \nthemselves in different realities that make exercises engaging and different, allowing them \nto keep their minds on accomplishing the task at hand. \n\nAR and VR increase activity for these patients, creating scenarios that compel them to \ncomplete their courses of care.\n\nIn a recent study, stroke patients who underwent virtual reality rehab had improved arm \nand hand movements compared to conventional rehab after four weeks of therapy. In the \nmonths following the study, doctors found that virtual reality patients continued to have \nbetter mobility than the non-virtual reality patients. \n\nPush the play button\n\nThe benefits of gamification in healthcare are myriad\u2014so why aren\u2019t more healthcare \ncompanies gamifying?\n\nhttp://Health insurer AIA Australia offers members the app AIA Vitality to cash in on a variety\rof rewards for healthy lifestyle choices.

Execution is key\u2014patients won\u2019t respond to games that are poorly\ndelivered or deployed, that don\u2019t effectively engage, or that rely on legacy technology.\n\nSuccessful gamification is all about experience design. Get into the mind of the patient and\nunlock motivation factors that will drive behaviors and provide a user experience to deliver\nthem, accomplishing business goals.\n\nThe game is the vehicle for solving patient needs. When considering gamification in\nhealthcare, we recommend the following questions:\n\n\u2022 What problem will this solve? \u2013 Regimen compliance, fitness goals, maintaining\nwellness, meeting rehabilitation goals, adjusting to a lifestyle change\n\n\u2022 Who are my patients? \u2013 Are they looking for health and fitness, monitoring chronic\nillness, improving rehabilitation experiences\n\n\u2022 What behavior is being driven? \u2013 Exercise, activity, diet, monitoring body data,\nappointment attendance\n\n\u2022 What is the motivation? \u2013 Monetary, discount, competition, journey\n\nFrom there, there are innumerable possibilities for building the perfect game, engaging \npatients, and providing better outcomes.\n\nGames drive positive outcomes\n\nGamification holds particular promise for the world of healthcare. From capitalizing \non health and fitness applications that are already in place, to leveraging AR and VR \ntechnology for immersive experiences, games have the power to drive positive outcomes.\n\nGamification disrupts traditional methods of customer engagement to make interactions \npositive, entertaining, and profitable. And by creating a motivation for patients to invest \nin their own health, healthcare businesses are able to lower costs, increase engagement, \nand improve population health.\n\nHow are you interacting with your patients?

This \nincludes bio processors capable of monitoring multiple biosignals \nsimultaneously that provide accurate, real-time data for diverse \nhealthcare and fitness wearable applications.  \n\nIOT SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT \nKIT FOR BIO SENSORS AND \nBIO PROCESSORS\n\n\n\ncase study IOT Software Development Kit forBio Sensors and Bio Processors 2\n\nBusiness Challenge\n\nThe transmission, storage and real-time processing of high-frequency bio signal data \nusing wireless, low power channels is challenging. With wearable devices, data sampling \nis continuous and battery consumption often has to be minimized to allow for days of \noperation on single charge. Monitoring bio signals is usually accomplished by sending raw \nsensor data to an edge device like a smartphone, processing the data and sending it to the \ncloud. Bringing real-time feedback to the user causes the battery power of smartphones to \nbe consumed rapidly, limiting practical application of the solution.\n\nProject Description\n\nIn order to reduce the battery consumption rate in end user devices, SoftServe moved \npart of signal processing logic to a wearable device DSP. By sending only small fraction of \ndata, the network bandwidth would be reduced; indirectly impacting battery life on both \nwearable and smartphone devices.\n\nSoftServe\u2019s R&D team developed a multi\u2013sensor data acquisition and processing \nplatform, utilizing wearable, mobile and cloud\u2013based service solutions over an Internet \nof Things (IoT) communications infrastructure. Specifically, fog and edge computing \narchitecture was implemented using wireless sensors, BLE connectivity, smartphone and \ncloud processing to enable real-time readings of human vital signs and other biosensors \nand motion data. This was streamed from smartphones to cloud based storage and \ndashboards. Android devices support sensor configuration, signal real-time monitoring \nand sending data to cloud server via UDP or TCP channels. User may access recorded \ndata or real-time streams from any modern web browser.\n\nThe R&D team also implemented and tested the thirty most used signal processing \nfunctions in C for ARM DSP on simulators and hardware.

This evolution of digital dis-\nruption is forcing established players in \nthe retail industry to satisfy the demands \nof increasingly connected, demanding, and \nfickle customers. The retail industry is often \ndivided into two separate camps: online and \noffline. Whilst the urge to jump on the dig-\nital revolution bandwagon is there, rushing \nto keep up with consumer demand, retail-\ners also prefer to keep their brick and mor-\ntar side of the business going. 2020 is the \nyear of the omnichannel strategy for retail-\ners. When you merge online and offline to \ndeliver the best possible experience for your \ncustomers.\n\n\n\nwhitepaper Phygital Experience Strategy 3\n\nThe separation of brick and mortar and \nonline shopping (including e-commerce, \n\ns-commerce, and m-commerce) is making cus-\ntomers decide whether to purchase online \nor offline. The key is to have a perfect blend \nof providing both online and offline omni-\nchannel experiences that exceed customer \nexpectations. According to a 2019 survey of \n2,000 global consumers by the Chief Mar-\nketing Officer (CMO) Council, in partnership \nwith Pitney Bowes, revealed more than 85 \npercent consumers prefer a blend of both \ndigital and physical channel experiences as \nthe preferred way of interfacing with brands. \nHowever, only 13 percent believe brands are \nfully meeting this expectation. \n\nThus, the idea of merging the digital with the \nphysical worlds through technological inno-\nvation is increasingly becoming a necessity \nfor brands worldwide. The concept of \u2018phy-\ngital\u2019 bridges the gap between the online \nand offline consumer journeys and ensures \nunique interactive experiences for each indi-\nvidual customer. Phygital is depictive of how \nphysical and online retail channels are merg-\ning, blurring, and influencing each other in \ninnovative ways. \n\nhttps://www.pitneybowes.com/content/dam/pitneybowes/us/en/campaign-pages/cmo-council-report/critical-channels-pb-report-full-data-final-w-commentary.pdf\nhttps://www.pitneybowes.com/content/dam/pitneybowes/us/en/campaign-pages/cmo-council-report/critical-channels-pb-report-full-data-final-w-commentary.pdf\nhttps://www.pitneybowes.com/content/dam/pitneybowes/us/en/campaign-pages/cmo-council-report/critical-channels-pb-report-full-data-final-w-commentary.pdf\nhttps://www.pitneybowes.com/content/dam/pitneybowes/us/en/campaign-pages/cmo-council-report/critical-channels-pb-report-full-data-final-w-commentary.pdf\n\n\nwhitepaper Phygital Experience Strategy 4\n\nTo excel in this new environment, digi-\ntal and physical touchpoints must be \n\nblended in a manner that provides richer \nand more targeted customer experi-\nences. Consumers and shoppers now have \nin-store, online e-commerce, m-commerce, \nand s-commerce networks. As consumers \nmove from reading/writing reviews to voice \nsearch to virtual reality (VR) \u201cbefore-you-\nbuy\u201d experiences, it would be fascinating to \nwitness how Phygital evolves over time. \n\nThe retail industry is learning to evolve digi-\ntally at the pace required by demand or face \nextinction. How digital influences occur at \nhome and in store has an immediate impact \non customer experience. Many retail stores \nare now \"clicks and mortar\", and hence cus-\ntomer-centric. But what does it mean to be \ncustomer-centric in the Phygital era? Phy-\ngital strategies aim at making the following \nterms a reality: immediacy, immersion, and \ninteraction.\n\n\u2022 Immediacy: making sure messaging \nhappens at the exact moment in time \nin response to real-time customer \ninteractions\n\n\u2022 Immersion: making sure users are \nactively involved in the experience \nregardless of the preferred channel\n\n\u2022 Interaction: making sure communication \nactivates the physical/emotional part of \nthe purchasing process\n\nIn theory, unifying a customer\u2019s physical and \ndigital behavior should be implemented by \nevery customer-centric business. However \nthat is only plausible by making sure the cor-\nrect technology is set in place. That includes \ncapturing, processing, and ingesting a large \namount of customer data to acquire enough \ncontextual queues\u2014for personalized cus-\ntomer experiences across channels and \nmultiple interactive devices.\n\nCAPTURING THE DATA\nA 2019 retail by BCG revealed customers \nwere 110 percent more likely to purchase \nfrom a brand offering personalized services \nbased on their preferences, and 40 percent \nmore likely to spend more than they had \nplanned. However, only 20 percent of them \nare satisfied with the level of personaliza-\ntion they receive from companies. \n\nBridging the gap between the physical and \nthe digital world not only enriches the cus-\ntomer experience and strengthens the \nemotional bond with a brand but also gen-\nerates additional contextual data about the \ncustomers shopping behavior. This allows \nfor brands to reach out to customers with \nhyper-personalized messages at the correct \nmoment and place, whilst taking into consid-\neration the customer\u2019s preferred purchase \nlocation, payment method, social media \nactivity, and more. \n\nhttps://www.bcg.com/publications/2019/next-level-personalization-retail.aspx\n\n\nwhitepaper Phygital Experience Strategy 5\n\nAnother situation could be when a cus-\ntomer spends time window shopping \n\nfor headphones but leaves without pur-\nchase. Why not respond to this behavior \nthrough a targeted e-mail campaign provid-\ning a personal discount? Such a data-driven \ncampaign would prove to be much more \neffective than just a personalized e-mail \nsubject line because the customer\u2019s needs \nare well-understood.\n\nBy continuing their focus on being data-\ndriven, retailers can access, collect, and \ningest existing data into a centralized sys-\ntem to drive decision-making; train a model \nto accurately interpret masses of data; and \nproduce an outcome that will provide cus-\ntomers with a personalized shopping expe-\nrience. Insights can help to gain an accurate \nand deep understanding of the data. \n\nAt SoftServe, we have developed a Demand \nPrediction solution that considers custom-\ners different patterns and purchasing habits \nover time, location, and channel to answer \ntheir needs and effectively manage the \nstock. \n\nIn order to incorporate insights from cus-\ntomers\u2019 physical interactions, we have listed \nbelow key technologies that can help extract \nthe context for each individual to serve a \nhighly personalized and connected omni-\nchannel experience.\n\nMOBILE\n\nSEARCH\n\nSTORE\n\nPAID MEDIA\n\nCALL CENTER\n\nINTERNET OF\nTHINGS\n\nEVENTSSOCIAL\n\nWEBSITE\n\nEMAIL\n\nhttps://demo.softserveinc.com/sorry/\nhttps://demo.softserveinc.com/sorry/\n\n\nwhitepaper Phygital Experience Strategy 6\n\nBEACONS\n\nBeacons are small, wireless transmitters \nthat use low-energy Bluetooth \n\ntechnology to connect and transmit \ninformation to multiple interactive devices \nmaking location-based searching and \ninteraction easier and more accurate. \nThey can be used in some of the following \nscenarios:\n\n\u2022 A mobile app can be programmed to \nautomatically provide targeted content \n(info, ads, or promos) whenever a \ncustomer\u2019s interactive device comes \nwithin a certain range of a beacon. \nThis means each user can be provided \nwith relevant content through a push \nnotification whenever they get close to \na certain geolocation, such as a physical \nstore.\n\n\u2022 Beacons can also assist brands by \nproviding a customers\u2019 location within \nthe store itself, analyze their behavior \nwhen shopping (i.e. what they browsed, \nhow much time they spent browsing, \nwhat they bought, and more), and save \nthis information within their profile to \noffer better, more personalized offers in \nthe future, thus improving the customer \nexperience. \n\n\n\nwhitepaper Phygital Experience Strategy 7\n\nRFID & NFC\n\nRadio-frequency identification (RFID) is \na remote sensing technique allowing \n\nmicrochip data to be read over a radio path \nbetween 50 centimeters and 10 meters, \ndepending on the type of the RFID tag. \nThese cards are mounted on a product \nand can communicate with the customer\u2019s \nmobile phone, providing product informa-\ntion, how it was manufactured, or how to \nuse it. Similarly, Near-field communication \n(NFC) technology is also used to send infor-\nmation to customers by enabling two elec-\ntronic devices by bringing them within 4 cm \nof each other.\n\n\u2022 As RFID technology allows products to \nbe tagged within a physical environment, \none way to utilize them for improving the \ncustomer experience is by connecting \nchips to smart mirrors/touch screens or \ntablets. This allows customers to find more \ninformation about a specific item. In some \nindustries, it is also possible for customers \nto virtually \u2018try on\u2019 a product. \n\n\u2022 RFID chips automatically scans tagged \nproducts, allow customers to quicken the \ncheckout process. This results in customer \ndata being stored for future usage, \nenabling retailers to provide a personalized \nexperience, creating happy customers!\n\nAI & QR CODES\n\u2022 Through a blend of facial recognition, \n\nmotion capture, sensors, QR codes, and \nartificial intelligence (AI), customers can \nnow select items they want, scan the \ncode using multiple interactive devices, \nand leave without passing through a \ntraditional checkout line to save time. \n\n\u2022 It is also possible to display a company\u2019s \nproducts outside the physical stores, \nwhere potential customers can browse \nthrough and select the products of their \nchoice by scanning and paying via a QR \ncode.

This \nis achieved by providing a personalized \nexperience to every user, including real-\ntime tracking and smart voice assistant \nfor guidance and support depending on \nthe level of proficiency. \n\nAR/VR\n\u2022 Augmented reality (AR) can be used to \n\nenhance the physical part of the customer \njourney through techniques such as \nscanning or photographing products to \nautomatically allow for redirection to the \nrespective product page on the brand \nwebsite for additional information or \npurchasing online. \n\n\u2022  More complex cases include customers \nenjoying a shopping experience without \nhaving to go to the physical store by \nwearing a virtual reality (VR) headset. \nIn 2018, Amazon opened VR kiosks in \nshopping malls to promote Prime Day \nshopping event, allowing customers \nto see what the products look like \nbefore they can purchase them. The VR \ntechnology can also be integrated with a \npayment platform, enabling customers \nto make transactions online seamlessly. \n\n\u2022  SoftServe have developed an AR card app \nallowing customers to securely perform \ncore financial operations without the \nneed of carrying cash, a credit card, or \neven an interactive device\u2014customers \njust need to wear smart glasses. That \nincludes getting an instant virtual \ndescription, including price, payment \noptions, and return policy when a \ncustomer views an item on storefront \nshelves. \n\nhttp://https://demo.softserveinc.com/sorry/\nhttp://https://venturebeat.com/2018/07/12/watch-amazons-vr-kiosks-transform-the-future-of-shopping/\nhttp://https://venturebeat.com/2018/07/12/watch-amazons-vr-kiosks-transform-the-future-of-shopping/\nhttp://https://www.softserveinc.com/en-us/resources/demo/payments-using-augmented-reality/\n\n\nABOUT US\nSoftServe is a digital authority that advises and provides at the cutting-edge \nof technology.

Driven by new emerging pain points \nin the use of electronic medical health records, ISVs will face both \nnew challenges and new market opportunities. As competition from \nall sides increases, the innovation and discipline of software vendors \nwill be challenged in the coming years. In this white paper, we explore \na number of significant trends that will shape the future of ISVs and \ndeliver new solutions for an ever-growing health IT market. \n\n2015 was overshadowed with scandals of health data breaches, health \ndata attacks and current security weaknesses. Experts say that criminal \nattacks in healthcare are up 125% since 2010. This is important news for \nISVs providing healthcare software solutions to providers. \n\nNevertheless, the power and responsibilities of electronic health records \n(EHRs) is undeniable. Leading experts conclude that EHR systems have \nalready proven to be effective in improving patient care, increasing \npatient safety, streamlining work processes at healthcare facilities, and \nreducing treatment time. \n\nWith Great Power Comes Great Responsibility\n\nBut to quote the Spiderman movie, \u201cwith great power comes great \nresponsibility\u201d. From this point forward EHRs are becoming a more \nimportant element of the healthcare ecosystem, and software vendors \nwill need to become more aware of which new technologies they want \nto invest in, so it is important to make the right choices now.\n\nTo meet the challenges of healthcare providers and patients, ISV \nsolutions will need to sit in a sweet spot that fits seamlessly into the US \nhealthcare provider\u2019s systems or in a patient\u2019s pocket. These solutions \nneed to fit the provider\u2019s operational workflow and structure as precisely \nas the elements of a jigsaw puzzle. And with the global EHR market value \nexpected to grow to $23.98 billion by 2020, huge rewards are at stake.\n\nhttp://www.ponemon.org/news-2/66\nhttp://www.transparencymarketresearch.com/electronic-health-records-market.html\nhttp://www.bio-itworld.com/Press-Release/Electronic-Health-Records-(EHR)-Market-Expected-to-Reach-USD-23-98-Billion-Globally-in-2020/\n\n\nwhite paper\n\nWHERE IS THE FUTURE? 3\n\nHow Did We Get Here?\n\nWith all honesty, the emergence of electronic medical health records \nfor US providers didn\u2019t start off as a romance. Today, scientific \nresults suggest that patient trust in physicians, and security in the \nphysician-patient relationship, override most patients\u2019 concerns about \ninformation technology. But it took years for EHR technology systems \nto be accepted by doctors.\n\nToday ISVs who want to introduce and implement technology solutions, \nneed to increasingly understand the importance of the physician-patient \nrelationship, the emotional drivers to use technology in front of the \npatient, the limitations of technology, and how both parties feel when \ntechnology is being used.\n\nBack in January 2009 the Health Information Technology for Economic \nand Clinical Health Act (HITECH), a $30 billion initiative, tried to \ntransform healthcare delivery via widespread use of EHR systems. \nChange and adoption accelerated when the federal government could \nafford to push for a paperless future of healthcare data. According to \nthe Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, the federal government \nbacked an initiative to drive healthcare to paperless operation by \nspending more than $25 billion in incentives for adopting EHR. \nToday, as many as 478,000 health care providers receive payment to \nparticipate in the Medicare and Medicaid Electronic Health Record \nIncentive Programs.\n\nhttp://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2906526/\nhttp://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2906526/\nhttp://searchhealthit.techtarget.com/definition/HITECH-Act\nhttp://searchhealthit.techtarget.com/definition/HITECH-Act\nhttps://www.cms.gov/\nhttps://www.cms.gov/Regulations-and-Guidance/Legislation/EHRIncentivePrograms/index.html?redirect=/ehrincentiveprograms\nhttps://www.cms.gov/Regulations-and-Guidance/Legislation/EHRIncentivePrograms/index.html?redirect=/ehrincentiveprograms\n\n\nwhite paper\n\nWHERE IS THE FUTURE? 4\n\nSoftware Customers Users\n\nFollowers\n\nTwitter Facebook LinkedIn\n\neClinicalWorks 100000 600000 18175 4797 9224\n\nMcKesson 40000 200000 9610 11586 118763\n\nCureMD 39322 192186 3701 12911 2853\n\nPractice Fusion 17000 150000 10727 21262 5904\n\nAllscripts 10000 180000 12750 5490 50789\n\nCerner 10000 75000 25926 13643 75528\n\nGreenway 13000 100000 6772 3142 7678\n\niPatientCare 10262 64652 1263 247 689\n\nEpic 295 273000 0 7502 126\n\nathenahealth 8776 12139 13673 6180 21198\n\nNextgen 4400 85000 16220 3125 11094\n\ne-MDs 9100 30000 3095 876 2071\n\nNueMD 8000 24000 2133 1446 978\n\nKareo 6000 9000 7100 22587 3027\n\nPraxis 5500 40000 845 90 195\n\nSOAPware 5000 30000 788 2039 328\n\nAmazing Charts 6800 10000 1268 1408 1020\n\nCareCloud 2000 10000 6242 2610 4874\n\nMeditab 100 30000 361 918 1115\n\nAdvancedMD 4400 10000 1272 857 4994\n\nHEAD TO HEAD COMPETITION (TOP 20)\nWhich are the leading electonic medical records (EMR) software products\n\nGraphic\u2019s data source: Capterra\n\nhttp://www.capterra.com/electronic-medical-records-software\n\n\nwhite paper\n\nWHERE IS THE FUTURE? 5\n\nThe EHR Market Today\n\nFor electronic medical record (EMR) products, it turns out that there are \njust a handful of companies that rule the US market place. Capterra, \nwhich connects ISVs to buyers, currently counts 307 EHR products \non their website. The top 5 products alone cover more than 200,000 \ncustomers and more than 1.4 million users.  \n\nCapterra reports that the market size for this area could amount to $6 \nbillion, and grow at a rate of 16% per year. Other sources, including \na report by Kalorama Information, suggest that the EMR market is \nexpected to grow at only 7 - 8% over the coming five years. It roughly \nmeets the calculations of consulting firm Accenture, which expects the \nU.S. market for this sector to reach $9.3 billion with 7.1% annual growth. \n\nOn a global scale, Accenture announced at the 2015 HIMSS conference \nthat the global EHR market would reach $22.3 Billion by the end of 2015. \nThis would mean the US accounts for almost 42% of the global EHR \nmarket.  Despite the growth, the ability of healthcare leaders to achieve \nsustained outcomes and proven returns on their investments, would \npose a significant challenge to the adoption of electronic health records. \nBut new solutions by ISVs are expected to appear. According to Silicus, a \nstrategic partner to ISV services, vendors are now challenged to enhance \ntheir software product offerings, add new capabilities, and provide \nprompt support.\n\nIn the process of changing market needs, innovative solutions will \nemerge that can better adapt and scale electronic health records to \nmeet the needs of specific patient populations as well as the business \nneeds of health systems. These new software solutions will be able to \ndeliver on their data analytics promises, deliver improved portability \nfeatures, and will most likely be produced by ISVs. \n\nWith steep learning curves and already the next cycle of platform \nmigrations kicking off, existing vendors will be challenged to sustain the \ninnovation that is much needed in this market. The investments made \nto date into the products must keep up with the healthcare industry \ntrends: mobility, analytics, genetics and true interoperability. \n\nhttp://www.capterra.com/electronic-medical-records-software\nhttp://www.kaloramainformation.com/\nhttp://www.himss.org/Events/EventDetail.aspx?ItemNumber=27978\nhttps://newsroom.accenture.com/subjects/research-surveys/global-market-for-electronic-health-records-expected-to-reach-22-3-billion-by-the-end-of-2015-according-to-accenture.htm\nhttp://www.silicus.com/healthcare/software-vendors.html\n\n\nwhite paper\n\nWHERE IS THE FUTURE? 6\n\nEHR vs. EMR\n\nWhile both have often been used interchangeably, one of the major \ndistinctions which healthcare software system vendor athenahealth \npoints out on their website, is that the Office of the National Coordinator \nfor Health Information (ONC) suggests that EMRs contain the patient\u2019s \nclinical data, while electronic health records would go slightly beyond \nthe information array. EHR data would focus on the broader total health \nof each patient. This adds an important element to the discussion of \nhow and where ISVs are likely to create new products and services for \nthe different healthcare sub-sectors. \n\nathenahealth also presents an interesting case, on its own. According \nto a 2014 PWC report, the software company is ranked 85 on the Global \n100 software leaders list. With $407.50 million in revenue in 2012, the \ncompany has become one of the strongest software players in the US. \nSuccessful software solutions such as athenahealth are now competing \nalongside software giants such as Google and Apple.\n\n0\n2012\n\n5.5% CAGR\n\n2013 2014 2015\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n\nGLOBAL FORECAST FOR ELECTRONIC HEALTH RECORDS (EHR)\nAccenture study Estimates EHR Market to Reach $22.3 billion by end of 2015\n\nin\n b\n\nill\nio\n\nn\ns\n\nAn Accenture study shows the global market for electronic health records (EHR) \nis estimated to reach $22.3 billion with North America projected to account for \nroughly half with $10.1 billion\n\nSource: Accenture Analisys, 2014\n\nAPAC EMEA AMERICAS\n\n$18.8\n$19.8\n\n$20.9\n$22.3\n\nhttp://www.athenahealth.com/knowledge-hub/ehr/emr-vs-ehr\nhttp://searchhealthit.techtarget.com/definition/ONC\nhttp://searchhealthit.techtarget.com/definition/ONC\nhttps://www.pwc.com/gx/en/technology/assets/pwc-global-100-software-leaders-2014.pdf\nhttps://www.pwc.com/gx/en/technology/assets/pwc-global-100-software-leaders-2014.pdf\n\n\nwhite paper\n\nWHERE IS THE FUTURE? 7\n\nFive Trends Independent Software \nVendors in Healthcare Should Explore \n\n1. Mobile Health Data: Patient-Centric Devices Make \nEverything Go Mobile\n\nIn the 2014 EHR Software Buyer Report, Software Advice presented their \nresults from talking to medical practices searching for EHR software \nsolutions. An analysis from 385 integrations which aimed at uncovering \nphysician\u2019s most common pain points, revealed that mobile support \ntopped the list of requested features. According to Software Advice, \nalmost 40% of buyers wanted systems that would allow access from \ntablets or smartphones. Maybe more importantly, the report suggests \nthat some of the buyers expressed great urgency for a mobile access \nfeature. Such demand-driven trends should give ISVs an important clue \nto where the market is moving. \n\nINCREASED MOBILE ACTIVITIES (in %)\n\nPhysicians report performing more healthcare activities on a mobile \ndevice during the last four years.\n\nPhysician's Activities 2010 2014\n\nAccess electronic medical records 12 45\n\nPrescribe medications 14 41\n\nReview images 7 32\n\nCommunicate with patients 21 31\n\nReceive data from a medical devices 11 20\n\nInitiate and track a referral 6 17\n\nConduct clinical consult from different \nlocations than patient 5 12\n\n2014 HRI Clinician Workforce Survey and 2010 HRI Physician Survey.\n\nSource: pwc.se \n\nhttp://www.softwareadvice.com/resources/ehr-buyer-report-2014/\nhttp://www.pwc.se/sv/halso-sjukvard/assets/healthcare-delivery-of-the-future.pdf\n\n\nwhite paper\n\nWHERE IS THE FUTURE? 8\n\nAnother survey by Software Advice suggests that 58% of users who \naccess their EHR via a mobile device were \u2018very satisfied\u2019, while only 28% \nof non-mobile users expressed their contentment.\n\nA report by Black Book Rankings from 2013 revealed that 122 vendors had \nplans to launch fully functional mobile access or a native app for their EHR \noffering by the end of 2013, while another 135 vendors did not specify a \ntimeframe but said that such a move was planned for the near future. \n\nOne report after the other seems to point in the same direction: mobile \nis coming for EHR systems, and it is here to stay. ISVs will have no choice \nbut to adapt quickly if they want to keep up with the fierce competition. \nFrom Gmail to mobile messaging apps, access to real-time information \non the go has become commonplace for consumers over the past 10 \nyears, so why wouldn\u2019t we expect the same for healthcare?\n\nMobile Data Security\n\nOne big challenge to overcome for ISVs in the discussion of creating \npatient-centric device solutions, is data security. Over the past 10 \nyears 41% of breaches were caused, not by hacking, but by device \nloss. Due to the particularly bad record of keeping track of its devices, \nhealthcare has been responsible for more breaches than any other \nsector for the last decade. \n\nThis means that if software vendors decide to add and deploy mobile \nsolutions for their EHR offerings, they need to find ways to overcome \nhuman error. \n\nThe US startup TigerText for example built a communication platform \nfor health providers that lets them determine exactly how long \nmessage communication between healthcare professionals is saved. \nThis way, if a device is lost or stolen, not all data would be exposed, \nminimizing the damage.\n\n2. Cloud-based EHR: Health Records in the Cloud\n\nThe Holy Grail is to create a system where anyone entitled has secure \naccess to their data at the point when they need it. This is not only \n\nhttp://www.healthcaredatasolutions.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/HDS-Whitepaper-6-EHR-Trends-to-Watch-in-2015.pdf\nhttp://mobihealthnews.com/22753/survey-83-percent-of-doctors-would-use-mobile-ehr-apps-but-dont-have-access/\nhttp://www.informationisbeautiful.net/visualizations/worlds-biggest-data-breaches-hacks/\nhttp://www.informationisbeautiful.net/visualizations/worlds-biggest-data-breaches-hacks/\nhttp://www.tigertext.com/\n\n\nwhite paper\n\nWHERE IS THE FUTURE? 9\n\ntrue for sectors such as retail or banking, but increasingly also for the \nhealthcare industry. No one wants to go back to the days when we didn\u2019t \nhave 24/7 access to our email accounts on our smartphones.\n\nWill we think back in a few years and marvel at the days when we didn\u2019t \nhave access to our real-time vital signs stored in the cloud? Mahek Shah, \nan MD at athenahealth described in his Forbes article a growing demand \nby consumers to have greater access to their data, and options such as \nportability of the user\u2019s own health information. \n\nThe technical side of things is feasible. Take a look at one of Shah\u2019s \nexamples  where his company was able to send Ebola-related, patient \ntravel history questions via the electronic record system athenaClinicals \nwithin an hour of a media frenzy after a Dallas hospital sent an Ebola \npatient home. Shah\u2019s positivity about the opportunities of cloud \nbased EHR systems may be based on the fact that cloud based IT \ninfrastructures is capable of seamlessly pushing updates in near real-\ntime between providers and patients. \n\n3. Personalized Healthcare & Precision Medicine: EHR \nsystems will become increasingly \u201ctailor-made\u201d. A system \nneeds to meet specific demands by specific healthcare \nspecialties for specific needs by specific patients.\n\nIn the concept of precision medicine - or interchangeably called \npersonalized medicine - EHR systems could play an ever more important \nrole. For ISVs producing EHR solutions, it is worth looking at precision \nmedicine with a fresh pair of eyes.\n\nScott Mace explains in his post on healthleadersmedia.com that the idea \nis to incorporate genomic data into EHR systems. This incorporation \ninto the EHR ecosystem would commonly fall into the category of bright, \nshiny objects but luckily, EHR providers such as Epic are changing this \nperception right now.\n\nIn September, NorthShore University HealthSystem, an academic health \nsystem in the US, published findings about extensions to the Epic EHR \nsystem. The findings promise to improve patient safety, research, and \nclinical outcomes for 10 neurological disorders, with more than 2,000 \n\nhttp://www.forbes.com/sites/athenahealth/2015/04/13/3-technology-trends-transforming-health-care/\nhttp://www.athenahealth.com/leadership-forum/three-trends-transforming-health-care\nhttp://www.athenahealth.com/leadership-forum/three-trends-transforming-health-care\nhttp://healthleadersmedia.com/page-1/TEC-322083/How-Precision-Medicine-is-Unlocking-EHRs-Potential\nhttp://www.northshore.org/\n\n\nwhite paper\n\nWHERE IS THE FUTURE? 10\n\npatients already signed up to participate in the DNA biobank. If this trial \nproves successful and shows tangible results, more health providers \nin the US are likely to demand solutions that allow them to integrate \nsimilar precision medicine extensions into their EHR environment. As \nDemetrius Maraganore, Medical Director at NorthShore Neurological \nInstitute explains, it allows the creation of precision medicine at the \npoint of care, using a provider\u2019s EMR system. \n\nThe other conclusion from Maraganore\u2019s discussion is that EHR systems \nwill increasingly need to customize their features to the specialty of \nhealthcare in question. In Maraganore\u2019s case, it was neurology, but other \nareas could equally benefit from customization. Until now, Maraganore \nexplains that most neurologists have expressed frustration with EHRs \nas the systems seem to be designed to serve a broad spectrum of \nhealthcare interests, including US healthcare\u2019s meaningful use program, \nand would not add value for the practice of neurology, in particular. \nWhat ISVs need to think about is how to effectively serve the needs \nof specific healthcare sub-areas and this can only happen if ISVs work \ncloser together with healthcare specialties. \n\n4.  A Usability Trend: The Great Need for EHR Software \nSolutions to Become More User-friendly\n\nOne significant category of providers that raised their hands and now \nwant to switch to new EHR system solutions is ambulatory practices \naccording to a report by KLAS. Outpatient healthcare practices are \nconcerned with the features and modules current EHR systems offer \nand one of the most frequent concerns is usability. \n\nAccording to an article by HIT, as many as one out of every four \nambulatory EMRs systems could be at risk of being replaced. KLAS \nreport author Jared Dowland explained that the findings suggest larger \npractices intend to consolidate multiple EMR systems and tighten \nrelationships with nearby hospitals. Smaller ambulatory practices \nhowever would want to resolve functionality, support, and cost \nconcerns, Dowland reported. \n\nhttp://4\nhttp://www.klasresearch.com/\nhttp://hitconsultant.net/2014/08/27/klas-1-out-of-4-ambulatory-emrs-are-in-danger-of-being-replaced/\nhttp://hitconsultant.net/category/emr-ehr/\n\n\nwhite paper\n\nWHERE IS THE FUTURE? 11\n\nThis is an opportunity for both large and small ISVs to offer better EHR \nsoftware solutions. Whether specifically for ambulatory practices or not, \nthe number one reason physicians gave for switching from their current \nEHR system is usability, confirms another healthcare survey from 2014 \n(Healthcare Data Solutions survey). The survey of one million physicians \nalso found that user-friendliness was the most important feature of an \nEHR system today so ISVs need to build EHR systems with a more usable \nUX/UI in order to meet their customers\u2019 needs and remain competitive.\n\n5. Big Data Analytics for Personalized Healthcare\n\nOne of the most significant opportunities over the next five years \nis the use of big data analytics software to predict patients\u2019 health. \nIndependent healthcare providers such as Explorys Platform or Lumiata \nare expected to create and refine solutions that will allow spotting \npatterns, and even support healthcare providers to predict a person\u2019s \nfuture health. One indicator of a \u2018hot\u2019 technology is the steep increase \nin funding for tech startup companies working in that space and 2014 \nset a record for startup funding for big data/analytics companies in the \nhealthcare arena with $406 million 32 invested, an increase of 161% \nfrom the previous year. Large ISVs are expected to face more fierce \ncompetition from these well-funded smaller and medium sized tech \nstartup companies. PWC\u2019s HRI interview survey confirmed the increasing \nimportance of healthcare analytics software. The use of big data will \nallow patterns to be spotted and predicted, such as the likelihood \nof acquiring a disease or being admitted or readmitted to a hospital \nbased on a variety of health, genetic, environmental, and other social \nfactors. Data from EHR systems could complete the composition of a \nperson\u2019s predicted future health. Healthcare ISVs with EHR systems \non the market, need to think about how their software solutions will \nbe impacted by these changes. If a pattern is spotted, supported \nby sophisticated machine learning algorithms, predictive systems \ncould allow healthcare providers to anticipate medical problems and \nadverse events long before they are happening, enabling healthcare \nprofessionals to intervene and ultimately save lives. \n\nThe movie Minority Report from 2002 draws an interesting picture for \nthe future of police work: how to stop a potential crime before it actually \ntakes place. New predictive algorithms and analytical systems allow \n\nhttp://www.healthcaredatasolutions.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/HDS-Whitepaper-What-Physicians-Want-From-Their-EHRs2.pdf\nhttps://www.explorys.com/\nhttp://lumiata\nhttps://www.cbinsights.com/blog/healthcare-analytics-big-data-2014/\nhttps://www.pwc.com/us/en/health-industries/top-health-industry-issues/assets/pwc-healthcare-delivery-of-the-future.pdf\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0181689/\n\n\nwhite paper\n\nWHERE IS THE FUTURE? 12\n\nexactly this future for healthcare providers to prevent health issues. \nHowever, it could still take several years before providers start using \npredictive analytics on large patient populations.\n\nNew Terrain\n\nISVs now need to ask themselves new questions. It will no longer \nbe enough to have answers only on how to acquire, aggregate, \nstandardize, and make data available to people who shape strategies \nand deliver care. Instead, and more importantly, ISVs need to ask \nthemselves how they can produce the necessary insight seamlessly \nacross providers, in real-time, and bring this insight to the right people \ninside the organization.\n\nAn interesting example of how to leverage the power of big data \ncomes from IBM\u2019s research Lab in Israel. This includes IBM\u2019s effort to \nanalyze real world evidence (RWE). IBM\u2019s team concentrated on using \nmachine learning and deep analytics to understand the benefits of \nRWE data, which can include EMR, claims data, sources from scientific \nliterature, and even data from social media. So far work has been \nconcluded on disease areas such as epilepsy, diabetes, metabolic \nsyndromes, and mental illnesses. Analytics tools have then been built \nby the team to deliver semi-automatic data mining and predictive \nanalytics workflows for RWE analysis.\n\nConclusion\n\nWith great power comes great responsibility. This is true for the role \nof ISVs producing solutions for healthcare and the rules of the game \nhave become significantly more sophisticated.

Interest rate component type \nshould become a mandatory variable for all \nbusiness systems.\n\nReview capabilities of every source system \nand implement changes in the Stored \nProcedures and SSIS packages that will allow to \nconsume interest rate component type in the \ncorresponding tasks.\n\nAbsence of the \ndirect definition \nof the component \ntype in the existing \nstructure of the data \nwarehouse\n\nIn the existing data warehouse, there were \nno tables responsible for the identification of \nthe interest rate type. In the existing tables \nwe store only three types: \u201cFixed\u201d, \u201cVariable\u201d, \n\u201cDiscounted\u201d. The interest rate type \ndefinition is based on the logic that defines  \nthe difference between fixed period date and \ncurrent date.\n\nProduct tables should include a variable that \nwould allow to define interest rate component \ntype.\n\nMargin over \nreference interest \nrate calculations\n\nIn the existing structure of the data \nwarehouse we were calculating margin over \nLIBOR only. In the case of implementing rates \nsubstitutions, it was required to implement \na capability to calculate margin over the \ncorresponding reference interest rate. \n\nThe solution to this risk will be highly dependent \non the changes in the data structure that \nwould be made in the business systems, as \nthere could be different approaches to the raw \ndata extraction. In any case, the creation and \ncontinuous, updating of the dictionary of the \ninterest rate component type is required.\n\nHedging rate over \nreference interest \nrate calculations\n\nIn the existing structure of the data \nwarehouse we were calculating margin over \nhedge instrument rate. Implementation of \nthe substituting rates without corresponding \nmapping of the new rates with the new \ncorresponding hedging instruments could \nlead to inaccuracies in data. \n\nThe addition of the corresponding feeding \nsource (could be the same as used for the Rate \nand Rate Type DWH tables). The mapping of \nthe product table interest rate component \ntype variable with the corresponding hedging \ninstruments should also be done in the first \ninstance.\n\nPurchased books \nproduct/rate type \nsynchronization\n\nStandardize raw data from the origination \nplatform into the DWH format. Possible \nsubstitution of the reference interest rate \nin the purchased portfolio may lead to \ninaccuracies in the product table in the DWH.  \n\nData providers should include interest rate \ncomponent type in the CSV and XML files that \nwill allow to keep raw data structure aligned \nwith the DW structure. \n\nLack of data for the \ntreasury team\n\nUnder the current process, the treasury team \nhas to spend almost a full week to prepare \nportfolio information for the further hedging \nof the interest rate risk. The main problem \nis that the data warehouse does not include \ndirect information about the type of the \ninterest rate component. Implementation \nof the additional rates required additional \nmanual work.  \n\nCould create view that will allow to breakdown \nportfolio by interest rate component types.\n\ncase study |    Libor Compliance for European Bank 5\n\n\n\nSoftServe estimated the main impact of the \nLIBOR transition in part of the DWH being \nconcentrated to the needs of the regulatory \nreporting and finance team.

The global pan-\ndemic has created an urgent need for con-\ntactless biometric identification. SoftServe\u2019s \nexperts have been paying close attention to \nthe \u201ctouchless\u201d solutions that can potentially \nfulfill the need for non-contact in the new \nnormal. \n\nIn this whitepaper, we\u2019ll review different \ncontactless solutions, including their prog-\nress and challenges.\n\n\n\nwhitepaper |   TRENDS: Non-Contact Biometric Identification 3\n\nFACIAL RECOGNITION\n\nFace identification\u2014a popular Face ID beta proj-\nect solution used in modern smartphones\u2014is \n\nsuitable for touchless biometrics solutions. Unfor-\ntunately, during the pandemic period (with peo-\nple wearing face masks that cover both nose and \nmouth), algorithms that detect facial landmarks \nare rendered non-functional.\n\nHere's when the use of image recognition (IR) \ncameras comes into play.\n\nIR band is divided into Near-Infrared (NIR), Short-\nWave Infrared (SWIR), Mid-Wave Infrared (MWIR), \nand Long-Wave Infrared (LWIR) sub-bands. The \nfirst two are reflection dominant bands and are \nusually used for capturing face and iris images. \nNIR helps in low-light conditions, whereas SWIR is \nused in lower visibility instances. \n\nMWIR and LWIR sub-bands are emission domi-\nnant and produce thermograms of an object. For \nthe use of ML and AI algorithms, corresponding \ndata sets have been created containing images \nobtained in different spectral bands:\n\n\u2022 Carnegie Mellon University \nHyperspectral Face Dataset (CMU-HSFD)\n\n\u2022 The Hong Kong Polytechnic University \nHyperspectral Face Database (HK PolyU \n\u2013 HSFD)\n\n\u2022 UWA Hyperspectral Face Database \n(UWA-HSFD)\n\n\u2022 CASIA HFB Database\n\n\u2022 CASIA NIR-VIS 2.0 Database\n\nDeep neural network (DNN) architectures \nhave also been adapted in IR solutions.

Most commer-\ncial iris identification systems work in near-infra-\nred range to break down the reflection patterns \nand variations in color. \nSeveral public iris identification databases exist:\n\u2022 IIT Delphi Iris Database\n\u2022 CASIA-Iris-Thousand Database\n\u2022 IIITD Multispectral Periocular Database\n\u2022 ND-IRIS-0405 database (captured by \n\nLG2200 iris image camera)\n\u2022 CrossSensor-Iris-2013 database \n\n(captured by both LG4000 and LG2200 \ncamera)\n\n\u2022 Visible Light Mobile Ocular Biometric \nDataset (acquired by iPhone 5S, \nSamsung Note 4 and Oppo N1 mobile \ncameras in three different illumination \nconditions)\n\n\u2022 Cross Sensor Iris and Periocular \nDatabase (captured by Sony Ericsson \nXperia Arc, Apple iPhone 4, ThL W200 \nand Huawei U8510 with both frontal and \nrear cameras with and without flash and \nunder different illumination conditions)\n\nAdditionally, new deep learning (DL) meth-\nods have been adopted for iris identification:\n\n\u2022 The usage of VGG-Net (accuracy level \nabout 99.4% on IIT Delhi Iris Database) \nand LightCNN29 networks for  \niris identification\n\n\u2022 The creation of DeepIrisNet \u2013A, \nDeepIrisNet-B as well as the usage of \ntraditional image processing approaches \n(Haar Wavelet - 96.6% accuracy, Log-\nGabor Filter - 97.2% accuracy, Fusion - \n97.4% accuracy, Elastic Graph Matching \n- 98% accuracy, texture+scattering \nfeatures - 99.2% on IIT Delhi Iris \nDatabase)\n\nEAR IDENTIFICATION\n\nEar identification is used when a person is \nwearing a mask or respirator. Recognition chal-\n\nlenges arise because ears are usually captured \nunder different angles and lighting, often with \npart of the ear covered by accessories. \n\nThe first ear Identification methods were built on \na constrained image database, using one camera \nangle, and in single lighting conditions. Usually, \nsimple geometric, local (descriptor-based) image \napproaches, or a combination of both were used. \nEarly solutions also sought to adapt well-known \nimage classification architectures (VGG, ResNet, \nImageNet) to ear recognition.\n\nThe most recent field testing uses different deep \nlearning networks for ear identification. More \nsophisticated solutions were specially built for ear \nrecognition through a three-stage process: \n\n\u2022 Whole ear image is captured\n\n\u2022 Different parts are captured to analyze \ndifferent ear regions\n\n\u2022 Data from first two is combined  \n\nNetworks are usually trained and tested on \nExtended Annotated Web Ears (AWEx) or the \nUnconstrained Ear Recognition Challenge (UERC) \ndata set. Original data sets are usually modified \nby combining ear images with images of gener-\nated ear accessories.\n\nLast year\u2019s research in the field of iris identi-fi-\ncation used 3D models of iris (reconstruction \nfrom 2 photos) instead of 2D images to make \nidentification more robust. Commercially ava-il-\nable Iris recognition sensors were proposed by \nAOptix Technologies.\n\nhttps://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0031320309003343?via%3Dihub\nhttps://arxiv.org/abs/1409.1556\nhttps://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1077314211001081?via%3Dihub\nhttps://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1077314211001081?via%3Dihub\nhttps://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/0031320395000674\nhttps://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/0031320395000674\n\n\nwhitepaper |   TRENDS: Non-Contact Biometric Identification 5\n\nGAIT IDENTIFICATION\n\nResearchers claim that walking style is unique \nfor every person which has resulted in differ-\n\nent gait identification systems. Many systems use \nvideo from surveillance (or similar) cameras to \nanalyze silhouettes or binarized video patterns.\n\nThere are also quick and cheap implementations \nreusing existing Wi-Fi infrastructure with CSI capa-\nbilities with sensors using new DL techniques for \nclassification. More complex solutions require \ncovering a floor with different sensors including \npressure, light, capacitance, and EM noise. \n\nSuch approach is slower to be deployed. An addi-\ntional advantage of gait identification is the possi-\nbility of recognizing human emotions simultane-\nously with identification.\n\nFINGERPRINT \nIDENTIFICATION\n\nFingerprints have long been used as a \nmethod for biometrics identification \n\nand became the most popular solution for \nunlocking phones, laptops, and other smart \ndevices. The main challenge during the \npandemic, of course, is that most sensors \nrequire tight contact with a finger.\n\nFortunately, contactless fingerprint sensors \nhave been intensely researched by scien-\ntists and developers over the last several \nyears. Today, there is already a wide range \nof different contactless solutions on the \nmarket ranging from researchers/hobbyists' \nproposals of web camera use with an open \nCV library for processing, to state-of-the-\nart sensors and solutions that reuse smart-\nphone cameras. \n\nSome solutions have been certified by the \nUnited States\u2019 Federal Bureau of Investiga-\ntions (FBI) in response to hackers stealing \nfingerprints from high definition images \nplaced in online media.\n\nContactless fingerprint identification allows \nus to improve hygiene, speed up access con-\ntrol, and identity processing in high traffic \nareas\u2014but recognizing the many shapes \nand sizes poses a challenge. As long as indi-\nviduals are encouraged to wear protective \ngloves in public, this technology will also be \nsubject to pandemic-caused limitations.\n\n\n\nwhitepaper |   TRENDS: Non-Contact Biometric Identification 6\n\nADDITIONAL NON-\nCONTACT METHODS\nAdditional solutions that have found their \nway to market include:\n\n\u2022 Finger vein (popular in banking and \nfinancial applications)\n\n\u2022 Retina identification (requires an eye \nin front of the sensor)\n\n\u2022 Hand palm or dorsal palm\n\n\u2022 Footprint (applied in places where \npeople are usually without shoes: \nswimming pools, beaches, hospital \nbeds)\n\n\u2022 Voice (works for people in face masks \nas well as biosafety suits with additional \nrecognition system setup)\n\nAgain, the current pandemic limits many \nof these options, but by combining several \ncontactless methods it is possible over-\ncome the temporary challenges created by \nsocial distancing and protective measures. \nEnterprises already or planning to leverage \nbiometric security could gain a competitive \nadvantage by exploring the right combina-\ntion of traditional and contactless identifica-\ntion solutions.\n\nLet\u2019s talk about where you are in the bio-\nmetric identification journey and how our \nexperts can help you to accelerate your con-\ntactless security measures for the future.\n\nhttps://www.softserveinc.com/en-us/contact\n\n\nABOUT US\nSoftServe is a digital authority that advises and provides at the cutting-edge \nof technology.

The continuous development \nand complexity of information processing automation presupposes the \ndecisive role of security in information technology. 2015 was especially \nrich in cyber-attacks with companies such as T-Mobile, Kaspersky, and \nAnthem having had their security compromised and all sorts of personal \ninformation about users exposed.\n\nHaving a close look at the informational environment of any organization, \nit\u2019s not hard to see that applying traditional safety measures is a rather \nprohibitive approach, and often ineffective. Since there is a whole range of \npossible scenarios in a user\u2019s workflow within the security system, basic rules \nface multiple exceptions, reducing preventive protection and making the \nregular analysis of inner threats identification more complicated. Detecting \nexternal attacks is also becoming more and more problematic since attackers \nare aware of typical intrusion detection means and apply covert agents for \nthe attack. Here are main types of the network security breach: \n\nSecurity Violation\n\nScan DoS Attack Virus Attack Modification Traffic Analyzers\n\nFig. 2.  Network Security\n\nThese processes may be spotted, for instance, due to the increased activity \nof certain ports, new unusual services, changes in a user\u2019s work with \nnetwork resources, etc.\n\nOne possible solution to this problem is the development of systems that \nidentify unusual user network behavior, based on analysis of network \n\nhttp://www.cio.com/article/2857673/security/5-information-security-trends-that-will-dominate-2015.html\nhttp://www.forbes.com/sites/quora/2015/12/31/the-top-10-security-breaches-of-2015/\nhttp://www.forbes.com/sites/quora/2015/12/31/the-top-10-security-breaches-of-2015/\n\n\nwhite paper\n\nANOMALY DETECTION \u2013 UNSUPERVISED APPROACH 4\n\nactivity logs. Using data mining techniques, these systems reveal indicative \nbehavior patterns and draw conclusions about behavior that differs from \nwhat\u2019s considered conventional. The systems may though be self-adaptive, \nminimizing human involvement in configuring the system. Without taking \ninto account an organization\u2019s specifics, such systems are of particular \ninterest to specialists in the field of machine learning and data mining.\n\nIn this paper our Data Science Group (DSG) describes informational \nsecurity risk identification by detecting deviations from the typical pattern \nof network activity.\n\nAnomaly Detection \u2013 What\u2019s in a Name\n\nFollowing its etymology, an anomaly is any deviation from a rule. \nConsequently any violation of the standard behavior traced in historical \ndata can be interpreted as an anomaly. However, pattern violation \nmay be both known in advance and established as a result of analysis. \nIn this context, any problem related to the detection of non-standard \nbehavior leads to a search of the underlying condition (baseline) and the \nclassification of each event is recorded in the system as corresponding to \nor inconsistent with the found prototype.\n\nTalking about information security, this task may be accomplished \nby means of analyzing user activity and network equipment to detect \nirregular behavior in the external and internal network traffic (analysis \nof Netflow logs) which may serve as a signal of both internal activity and \nan attempted external attack. So, an anomaly is any event which may be \nestimated as statistically impossible in accordance with analysis results of the \nnetwork activity protocol. Here are three types of detected anomalies:  \n\n1. Significant deviation of the observed values from the expected value\n\n2. Failure in the process reflecting the change of the measured \nparameter within the surveillance area\n\n3. An atypical set of observed values in the measured parameters\n\nhttp://www.tripwire.com/state-of-security/security-data-protection/human-factors-effective-information-security-management-systems/\nhttp://www.cisco.com/c/dam/en/us/products/collateral/security/ios-network-foundation-protection-nfp/prod_presentation0900aecd80311f49.pdf\n\n\nwhite paper\n\nANOMALY DETECTION \u2013 UNSUPERVISED APPROACH 5\n\nStandard Netflow logs contain the following set parameters:\n\n1.

Anomaly Detection - Infrastructure\n\nhttps://www.first.org/global/practices/Netflow.pdf\n\n\nwhite paper\n\nANOMALY DETECTION \u2013 UNSUPERVISED APPROACH 6\n\nThe core of the proposed system lies in the ensemble of models, each of which \nallows estimation of the average statistical activity of users (or groups of users) \nand classifies the observations recorded in the system as corresponding to \nnormal or abnormal. The following metrics and measurement categories were \nused as the data source for constructing models:\n\n1. Total amount of \ntransferred data \nper time unit\n\n2. Total number \nof requests per \ntime unit\n\n1. Protocol type\n\n2. Source port\n\n3. Receiver port\n\n4. IP addresses group\n\nMetrics Category\n\nAccording to the anomaly types described above, we tried to combine \nthree different models: on one hand, to evaluate the nature of the metrics \nchange within different categories considering the accumulated data as \na process extended in time; on the other hand, to analyze the value of \nmetrics in different categories together for the isolated period of time.\n\n1. Dynamic Threshold Model allows an accepted level of assignment \n(measured value) to be set for specific time intervals (time of a day, \nweeks, months, etc.). Subsequently, each observed value is evaluated \nfor compliance with the threshold, making it possible to identify cases \nof the anomalies appearance. This model is a solution used to detect \nthe first type of anomalies.\n\n2. Association Rules Based Approach allows the activity of the network to \nbe described as an unrelated collection of events, and as a consequence, \npresenting it in the form of a stochastic process. Any event that is \ncharacterized by low probability can be interpreted as an anomaly.\n\n\n\nwhite paper\n\nANOMALY DETECTION \u2013 UNSUPERVISED APPROACH 7\n\n3. Time Series Clustering allows the identification of common \nregularities in the time series structure, capturing any deviation from \nthe established pattern at the same time (fitting the second type of \nanomalies).\n\nDynamic Threshold Model\n\nWhat lies at the heart of a Dynamic Threshold Model is representation of a \nuser\u2019s activity expressed as a set of measured parameter values (metrics) \nfor a certain observation category through a time series. It allows the \nestablishment of presence or absence of general tendencies that can be \nexpressed in the form of a general trend or have a seasonal character. For \nexample, we can consider a time series that reflects a week of network \nactivity of group members through the total amount of data transmitted in \none minute (Fig. 4). \n\nFig. 4. Time Series Example\n\n\n\nwhite paper\n\nANOMALY DETECTION \u2013 UNSUPERVISED APPROACH 8\n\nFig. 5. Flow of Anomaly Detection based on user activity\n\nThere is a common trend within this time section: through the week the \naverage user activity decreases. At the same time, the process cannot \nbe considered as proportional: there is a periodic sequence related to \nthe fact that the maximum and minimum activity fits in the middle of \nthe employees\u2019 work day and night-time correspondingly. In this way \neach day\u2019s activity can be described by a common pattern with minor \namendments from the primary trend. Then, user activity may be described \nin the form of a discrete time series (signal quantized in both time and \namplitude), along with evaluating a potential sampling error (allowed \ndeviation threshold) (fig. 5). If the replacement analogue signal with a \ndiscrete error exceeds the permitted deviation threshold, the situation can \nbe evaluated as an anomaly.\n\nThe next step is setting the maximum network load threshold for each part \nof the time series. The main reasoning behind this is to have average user \nactivity reflected in both series trending and seasonal components, with \nthe changes in load behavior taken into account.\n\n\n\nwhite paper\n\nANOMALY DETECTION \u2013 UNSUPERVISED APPROACH 9\n\nThe model shown allows the description of user activity in the network \nthrough a limited set of constants. This set can be obtained at the initial \nstage of system adjustment and doesn\u2019t require the entire set of historical \ndata analysis \u201con the fly\u201d to operate. \n\nIn addition, the model may be easily adapted to the changing process. If \nsignificant deviations of the discrete time series from the continuous one \nbecome more frequent, it is enough to merely adjust the threshold values \nand/or coefficients of the relative load.\n\nAssociation Rules based Model\n\nAs mentioned before, the process being monitored can be represented as \na set of linked events. Speaking about the activity of the user and/or group \nof users in the network, consider a single metric one-time value calculated \nfor the category and/or a several categorical variables combination. For \nexample, for sampling step time in 1 minute, estimate a total number of \ntransmitted packets by a department for 1 minute on a TCP/IP protocol \nin the first half of the work day and at the same time estimate the total \namount of packets via UDP protocol for the same user group.\n\nWe are not really interested in the absolute value of each of these \ncategories, but rather in the relative number of cases when this activity \nwas recorded.\n\nFor example, let\u2019s take a time series which reflects a needed parameter \n\nFig. 6.  Metric representation example\n\n\n\nwhite paper\n\nANOMALY DETECTION \u2013 UNSUPERVISED APPROACH 10\n\nchange in time. In most cases, the results of this measurement will be \npresented by a continuous variable, i.e. it takes an infinite number of \nvalues. Each value is unique within a quantization scale, which makes it \npossible to estimate the contribution of each individual observation in the \ncommon behavior pattern formation.\n\nFig. 7. Signal discretization\n\nHowever, it\u2019s not difficult to see that the measured value lies within certain \ndiscrete ranges, the sequence of which can be traced over time. Thanks to \nquantization, this fact facilitates shifting from a continuous representation \nto a discrete one. Limit the number of measured values by a finite set \nbreaking the entire values range to the equal density areas: \n\nTaking the time factor (T) into account, it becomes possible to allocate \nthose discrete random variable values that are highly unlikely for a specific \ntime line. So, in our example, the beginning and end of the working day \nare characterized by discrete random variable values from the set {6, 18, \n46}, while the range from 12:00 to 18:00 is characterized by a greater load: \n \n\n0.2 0.5 2 6 18 46 92 150 208 250\n\n0-6 0,42 0,17 0,17 0,17 0,07\n\n6-9 0,3 0,35 0,35\n\n9-12 0,14 0,43 0,38 0,05\n\n12-18 0,1 0,2 0,2 0,5\n\n18-21 0,35 0,45 0,2\n\n21-24 0,14 0,43 0,38 0,05\n\n\n\nwhite paper\n\nANOMALY DETECTION \u2013 UNSUPERVISED APPROACH 11\n\nWith this approach, the discrete random variable value (the analyzed \nparameter) defined by a small occurrence possibility within any time axis \narea (time slot) means getting out of the overall pattern, and consequently \n\u2013 the anomaly. Thus, for the time interval from 9:00 to 12:00 we get:\n\nSuch interpretation makes it possible to simultaneously analyze measured \nparameter values   for different categories; according to experimental \ndata it may be established that the value of one category suits for \nadjusting metric values   for the other. This means that there are common \ncombinations of values   in both categories. In this case, the information \nenhances certain pattern value. The more categories a frequent \ncombination combines, the higher the detecting pattern probability in the \nobserved process is, and the higher the deviation from it appears.\n\nLet\u2019s say, as based on the results of observations within one month, the \nfollowing activity was recorded in two different settings (M1 and M2):\n\nFig 8. Possible value boundaries\n\nFig 9. Observation results for two metrics\n\n\n\nwhite paper\n\nANOMALY DETECTION \u2013 UNSUPERVISED APPROACH 12\n\nDependence between individual values   of the observed value can be \nrepresented as a graph, where nodes are random events (system\u2019s state). \nEach event corresponds to a certain metric value or combination of several \nvalues,   and link weights reflect their conditional probabilities (Fig. 10 \n-left). As seen in the graph, the system behavior is described by a pattern \nset that can be found in each observation (system\u2019s state). This graph \ncan be simplified by means of small weight connection leveling and path \nreduction with a low total weight (Fig. 10 -right). As a result, we get a set of \nrules that define normal system behavior. \n\nThe problem of obtaining user activity patterns in the network faces the \nproblem of detecting associative links between individual states of the \nsystem described above, which form associative rules that describe the \nrequired patterns. This approach makes it possible to use known methods \nof mining association rules in order to recreate the average user activity, in \nparticular the Apriory algorithm. \n\nFig. 10. Stochastic Model \n\n\n\nwhite paper\n\nANOMALY DETECTION \u2013 UNSUPERVISED APPROACH 13\n\nEach of the rules selected is a component of the required user behavior \npattern: the bigger the number of rules for observation gets, the more \nsignificant the pattern may be considered, and the more likely it will \ncharacterize the expected behavior standard. As the observation rank, we \nused a normalized meaning of the weighted rules taking into account their \nlift, rule\u2019s performance at predicting cases measured against a random \nchoice. So for this example, we get:\n\nM1=<0.6) -> (M2 in [22, 30))\n\n(M1>154) -> (M2 in [14, 18))\n\n(M1>154) -> (M2 in [18, 22)))\n\n(M1 in [7, 46)) -> (M2 in [22, 30))\n\n(M1 in [0.6, 7)) -> (M2 in [14, 18))\n\n(M1 in [0.6, 7)) -> (M2 in [22, 30))\n\n(M1>154) -> (M2 in [22, 30))\n\n(M1>154) -> (M2>30))\n\n(M1 in [7, 46)) -> (M2>30))\n\n(M1>154) -> (M2<14)\n\n(M1=<0.6) -> (M2 in [18, 22)))\n\n(M1 in [7, 46)) -> (M2<14)\n\n(M1 in [46, 154)) -> (M2<14)\n\nM1=<0.6\n\nM1 in [0.6, 7)\n\nM1 in [7, 46)\n\nM1 in [46, 154)\n\nM1>154\n\nM2<14\n\nM2 in [14, 18)\n\nM2 in [18, 22)\n\nM2 in [22, 30)\n\nM2>30\n\n(M1 in [0.6, 7)) -> M2 in [18, 22))\n\nM1 in [46, 154)) -> (M2>30)\n\n(M1=<0.6) -> M2 in [14, 18))\n\n0\n,0\n\n0\n0\n\n0\n,0\n\n50\n0\n\n,1\n0\n\n0\n0\n\n,1\n50\n\n0\n,2\n\n0\n0\n\n0\n,2\n\n50\n0\n\n,3\n0\n\n0\n0\n\n,3\n50\n\n0\n,4\n\n0\n0\n\nFig. 11.  Rules importance\n\n\n\nwhite paper\n\nANOMALY DETECTION \u2013 UNSUPERVISED APPROACH 14\n\nThe lower the observation rank, the more reasons there are to believe that \nit is covered by the definition of anomaly.\n\nThe developed model allows several factors to be taken into account in \nassessing user activity, as well as describing it as a finite rules set, each of \nwhich is characterized by a certain level of significance in the found patterns \nsystem. Similar to the previous model, it can be used to analyze the process \nonline, and adapted to the changing process due to the revaluation of the \ndetected rules weight and/or by means of adding new ones. \n\nTime Series Clustering\n\nThe last model is based on the time series partition method which allows a \nset to be presented as a discrete segments ensemble that forms separated \ngroups (clusters) defined by the fact that time series components from the \nsame cluster are close to each other, while the fragments from different \nclusters are distinct. Here\u2019s an example of time series analysis:\n\n \n \nLine fragments highlighted in green have more in common than a red-\ncontoured one. In this case, they may be referenced to one group. To \nestimate the time series proximity degree (similarity), it is possible to \nuse a timeline dynamic transformation algorithm (DTW) which facilitates \nthe finding of optimal conformance by using time series fragments. \nThis method was used in speech recognition. The process of time series \nsegmentation presupposes formation of fragments plurality from this \nline by passing it with a floating window of a given size and with a certain \nsampling interval.\n\nFig 12.  Time series fragments similarity\n\n\n\nwhite paper\n\nANOMALY DETECTION \u2013 UNSUPERVISED APPROACH 15\n\nIn general terms, Fig. 13 depicts the basic process of the model in \nquestion, i.e. detection of the time series abnormal dynamics. \n\nThe result of the pairwise comparison of the obtained fragments through \na DW-distance evaluation forms the adjacency matrix which reflects the \nproximity degree between the fragments. The obtained matrix may be \nused as a basis for solving the issue of fragments clusterization.\n\nThe clusterization result of the first 13,000 minutes (80%) for three metrics \n(countInputUDP, countInputTCP and averagePacketSizeOutputUDP) is shown \nin the figure below. Fragments of the time series are displayed in the space \nof two principal components, while different colors distinguish components \n\nFig 13.  Abnormal dynamics detecting process\n\nFig 14.  Clusters representation\n\n\n\nwhite paper\n\nANOMALY DETECTION \u2013 UNSUPERVISED APPROACH 16\n\nfrom different clusters. In each case a single large cluster is formed out of the \ntime series fragments that constitute a common behavior pattern. Clusters of \nsmall size can be interpreted as an anomaly.\n\nClusters with small amounts of components are related to dynamics \nchanges, which isn\u2019t typical for the majority of cases. The level of these \ndeviations abnormality depends on a relevant set power. At the same time, \nthe significance of anomaly in a certain period of time can be determined \nby the number of metrics that were analyzed to identify the period.\n\nThe obtained model allows network activity to be estimated through \nthe dynamics of the measured parameter changes and/or measured \nparameters system, which may help identify abnormality even if the \nabsolute values lie within acceptable ranges. The only drawback it poses is \nthe complexity of usage \u201con the fly\u201d because its implementation requires \ncalculation of the similarity degree of the new observations with the \nexisting clusters elements.\n\nModels Ensemble\n\nTo maximize the effectiveness of the models used for the information \nsecurity violations detection, our Data Science Group decided to unite them \ninto one ensemble (Fig. 15). As seen from the diagram, the first two models \n(Dynamic Thresholds and Association Rules) use the same data set related to \nmeasurements according to N categories received in real time. This approach \nmay be referred to a begging model where the role of arbiter is performed \nby an Anomaly Confidence Level unit reestablishing the level of certainty that \nabnormal network activity takes place in the given time period. Meanwhile, \nthe Time Series Clustering model works with the pool of historical data which \npresupposes its inclusion in the model according to the boosting method. \n\nBecause of the differing usage modes between the models (online \nand offline), the model-based time series segmentation is the most \napplicable in non-business hours to clarify the situation when an \nanomaly hasn\u2019t been detected. According to the offline verification \nresults and further verification, the models are to be adjusted to the \n\n\n\nwhite paper\n\nANOMALY DETECTION \u2013 UNSUPERVISED APPROACH 17\n\nnew conditions, which leads to a change in a range of normal behavior \npatterns and, as a consequence, allows the observed process to be \ndescribed with more accuracy. \n\nMetrics\n\nPattern \nDatabase\n\nTime Series \nClustering\n\nVerification\n\nNormal \nBehavior\n\nAnomaly \nBehavior\n\nDynamic \nThreshold\n\nAssociation \nRules\n\nN\n\nN\n\nN\n\nAnomaly \nConfidence \nLevel1\n\nFig 15.  Ensemble of models\n\nConclusions \n\nWithin the framework of the conducted research, our Data Science Group \ncame up with a comprehensive solution to detect differing network activity \nof users or group of users as opposed to a well-known pattern, which in its \nturn may indicate attempts of an information security breach. The offered \nsolution is an ensemble of three models that facilitate analysis of three \nanomaly types:\n\n1. Significant deviation of the observed values from the expected \u2013 \nDynamic Threshold Model. Simplicity in implementation and its ease \nof adaptation are the main advantages of the model; on the other \nhand, the isolation of the analysis results for each individual metric \nfrom observations in other categories appears to be its downside, \nwhich makes it difficult to search for event patterns.\n\n\n\nwhite paper\n\nANOMALY DETECTION \u2013 UNSUPERVISED APPROACH 18\n\n2. Unusual set of the observed values of the measured parameters \u2013 \nAssociation Rules Based Model. The main advantage of this model is \nits ability to describe the observed process as a set of related events; \ninsensitivity to weak process dynamic changes is its main drawback.\n\n3. Unusual dynamics in the observed process \u2013 Time Series Clustering \nModel. Even though the found patterns in this model reflect the \ninternal dynamics of the observed process, it doesn\u2019t allow detection \nof event patterns and its application \u201con the fly\u201d is extremely difficult. \n\nThis is why we suggest using an ensemble model, since combined they \nneutralize all the disadvantages and facilitate decision-making regarding \nadaptation to the modified conditions. As a result, this solution allows \nboth typical abnormal network activity manifestations to be identified and \nunusual and new elements of the network anomalies to be detected, while \nthe self-adjusting capability lets the solution adapt to the \u201clegal\u201d changes in \nthe network processes.\n\n\n\nwhite paper\n\nANOMALY DETECTION \u2013 UNSUPERVISED APPROACH 19\n\nTetiana Gladkikh is a Data Scientist at SoftServe.

The pandemic has \nalso fundamentally changed the way \ntoom does business as more customers \ntake advantage of our Click&Collect, \nClick&Reserve and Click&Deliver \necommerce services. My role is to manage \nthese aforementioned services on our \necommerce site, toom.de, and ensure \ncustomers have an excellent shopping \nexperience.\n\nAnd how did you start working with \nSoftServe?\n\nHow we got to working with SoftServe is \na long story, but I will try to summarize. \nWhen toom was first creating its \necommerce site, the chief desire was to \nmake something as stable and functional \nas possible. For that reason, Magento was \nused as it is full stack working out of the \nbox. However, we soon discovered that our \ninfrastructure system couldn\u2019t cope with a \nhigh load and big amounts of data. As an \nexample, synchronizing inventory levels in \n400 locations for over 100k items in real \ntime just wasn\u2019t feasible in Magento alone. \nAt the time, we realized we need some help \nfrom an IT partner with a lot of experiences \nto solve the challenges that arose. So we \nhad to seek outside help.\n\nAnd why SoftServe?\n\nWell, to be honest, my first wish was to \nhire Magento developers directly. However, \nit was simply impossible though to find \nthe talent we needed locally. So we put \nout a tender to several different software \ndevelopment companies, including \nSoftServe. SoftServe won because their \nproposal hit all of the points we were \nlooking for and even some we hadn\u2019t \nconsidered. They were able to articulate \nwell how they would transition from our \nformer IT partner and gave us a concrete \ntimeline for ramp-up and achievement \nof the main project goals. In just three \nmonths, they were able to supply us with \nover a dozen capable engineers with the \nexact experience we needed.\n\nThis was all back in January 2020, and \nnow it\u2019s July 2021. Are you still happy \nwith the work SoftServe has done so far?\n\nAbsolutely. No question.\n\ncase study |    Headless Magento for Ecommerce 2\n\n\n\nWhat in particular stands out to you?\n\nBasically, the SoftServe team helped solve \nall of our main problems. We knew that we \ncould achieve a better customer experience \nby shifting from a monolithic Magento \napproach to microservices, but SoftServe \nwas the one to actually propose and deliver \non that. What they did in good cooperation \nwith our internal developers was decouple \nthe frontend from Magento and naturally \nsplit it within teams (consciously) adopting a \nmicro-frontends approach. That made our \nplatform not only more SEO-friendly, but \nalso robust, optimized and reliable.\n\nIn non-technical terms though, what are \nsome of the benefits of this approach?\n\nFirst and foremost, a better customer \nexperience. The site loads quicker, there \nare fewer errors adding items to cart and \nchecking out, and it\u2019s much easier for our \nUX and frontend team to make changes \nthan it was before. I know you asked for \nnon-technical but to explain, when we \nused Magento for the full stack, it was \nvery difficult for the front-end teams to \nmake changes to the website because they \nrelied on back-end teams to understand \nthe integration logic. SoftServe effectively \nhelped us to decouple the front end from \nMagento while keeping the back end intact \nand the site stable, so now changes that \ncould take days or weeks can now be \nexecuted in hours. \n\nThat\u2019s awesome! And what are some of \nyour goals for the short and long term \nfuture?\n\nIn the short term, continue to ensure \na good customer experience and \naccommodate the surging ecommerce \ndemand that hasn\u2019t been slowing down \neven as Germany reopens. In the long-term, \nsince crosschannel shopping is here to stay, \nwe are planning to roll out more features to \nmake it even easier and more convenient \nto shop without having to choose between \nonline or walking through the store. We \nwant to focus on interconnected retail and \npersonal consulting services.

They \nselected SoftServe because we are an AWS \nPartner Network (APN) Premier Consulting \nPartner, and because we leverage AWS best \npractices to help our customers solve their \nbusiness needs.\n\nOur client\u2019s business drivers included:\n\n\u2022 Multiregional deployment (latency \nimprovement). \n\n\u2022 Migration to a more scalable, secure \n(SOC 1 compliant), and performant \nenvironment in comparison to their \nexisting self-managed solution.  \n\n\u2022 Creating a cost-optimized solution for \ndatabase tenancy.  \n\n\u2022 Developing a cost- and performance-\noptimized solution for database forking \nthat included the creation of so-called \n\"sandboxes\" for our client\u2019s support \noperations. \n\n\u2022 Delivering a faster time-to-market \nsolution using the cloud provider's \nmanaged services.\n\nOur client\u2019s goal was to reduce the \ndeployment time with a successful \nmigration to the AWS Cloud, which would \nminimize the time required for onboarding \nnew dealers. \n\nThe project\n\nOverall, the SoftServe team was \nresponsible for completing project \nmigration from arriving on premises \n\nto the successful migration to AWS Cloud.   \n\nWe designed and created our client\u2019s \ninfrastructure in two separate AWS regions \nas three independent environments. \nIn the core of our client\u2019s migrated \ninfrastructure were multiple multi-node \nKubernetes clusters, together with \nseveral PostgreSQL databases.   \n\nFor infrastructure creation and deployment \npurposes, SoftServe introduced a \nTerraform Cloud-based framework \nsupported by Terraform Cloud Agents \ndeployed in corresponding AWS regions. \n\nCase Study SoftServe Migrates DMS Provider\u2019s Infrastructure to AWS Cloud 3\n\n\n\nBased on AWS methodologies and best practices, SoftServe performed this project in \nthree main stages, according to the AWS migration customer journey model, \nconsisting of: \n\nW  \n\nhen we begin migration projects, \nwe suggest to our clients that we \nstart with the assessment phase \n\nto learn more about their challenges, goals, \nand current solution. As an outcome of this \nresearch, we built a vision for the proof-of-\nconcept phase. And once it was proved, we \nplanned the migration itself. \n\nOn this project, we recommended to our \nclient to begin building infrastructure as \ncode (IaC) with Terraform to help with their \nchallenges. And once the project is \ncompleted, our client will only need a small \nteam to manage the infrastructure. \n\nSoftServe chose HashiCorp Terraform for \nthis project because, currently, it is the best \nand most flexible framework for IaC \nimplementation.  \n\nAlong with a robust, secure, and highly \navailable infrastructure, SoftServe delivered \n\nAssess: \n\nWe began by displaying our \nadditional value and \ncapabilities, worked to gain \nthe client team\u2019s trust, met \nwith key stakeholders and \naligned with them, identified \nother opportunities, and \nintroduced the MAP \n(Migration Acceleration \nProgram) to our client. \n\nMobilize: \n\nWe developed the \npreparation and validation \nof a reliable foundation in \nthe AWS Cloud with a pilot \nmigration of the customer's \ninfrastructure. \n\nMigrate and Modernize: \n\nWe planned the migration of \nthe customer's production \nworkloads to the AWS Cloud \nand the modernization of \nselected infrastructure \ncomponents for better \nperformance, security, and \ncost efficiency. \n\na Terraform Cloud-based framework that \nallows our client to control and develop \ntheir infrastructure in a reliable and secure \nway. The IaC configuration and deployment \npipeline was designed and implemented \nfollowing \"don't repeat yourself (DRY)\" and \n\"keep it simple stupid (KISS)\" principles, \nwhich was possible with HashiCorp \nTerraform Cloud.   \n\nOur client also had a big security issue with \na publicly exposed Kubernetes application \nprogramming interface (API) access. In \nresponse, SoftServe implemented \nTerraform Cloud Agent, which features \npull-based architecture, to address this \nconcern. \n\nTerraform Cloud Agent works as a part of \nour client\u2019s infrastructure, and the agent's \narchitecture is pull-based.

VHL\u2019s mission is to create superior quality language \nprograms that boldly integrate text, technology, and media.\n\nLANGUAGE LEARNING \nAPPLICATION DESIGN FOR \nVISTA HIGHER LEARNING\n\n\n\ncase study |    Language Learning Application Design for Vista Higher Learning 2\n\nBusiness Challenge\n\nTo encourage more users to learn languages through their \nproducts, Vista Higher Learning created an application to help \nintroductory students of Spanish successfully and confidently \ncommunicate in real-life situations. The current mobility era \npushed VHL to expand their products to mobile platforms and \ndevices. Hence, the company decided to iteratively transfer \nfeatures of their main Web product to mobile.\n\nThe application needed to be supported on both iOS and Android \nplatforms to serve the needs of more users. Having developed the \ncore features of the application, Vista Higher Learning partnered \nwith SoftServe to ensure its usability through unique design and \npowerful course management tools.\n\nProject Description\n\nWithin a 6-month project divided into three stages SoftServe\u2019s team of 2 iOS and 2 Android \ndevelopers, as well as a Quality Control engineer and a Project Manager accomplished the \nfollowing:\n\n\u2022 Stage 1. Refactoring and optimization of the existing iOS app code base; implementing \ntweaks to UX.\n\n\u2022 Stage 2. Building Android app from scratch (with functionality identical to iOS).\n\u2022 Stage 3. Reworking both iOS and Android apps to support bookshelf approach, i.e. \n\nwhen every book and every particular lesson within a book can be downloaded \nindependently from the rest of the content.\n\nTo streamline the process, increase stakeholders\u2019 awareness, and reduce rework, the \nSoftServe\u0300 s team:\n\n\u2022 Applied Scrum iterations of 1-2 week length\n\u2022 Established frequent communication (emails, Skype chat, on demand calls) with product \n\nowners and other decision makers to clarify requirements\n\u2022 Set daily stand-ups and delivered weekly demos for all stakeholders to report on every \n\niteration.\n\n\n\ncase study |    Language Learning Application Design for Vista Higher Learning 3\n\nThe collaborative SoftServe\u0300 s and VHL\u0300 s teams accomplished the following: \n\n\u2022 Divided the application features into two groups: functional units and content. As \na result, functionality handled content by parsing the appropriate XML files, which \nallowed customization or a complete update of lesson materials without any changes to \nthe application logics.\n\n\u2022 Enabled the application in both online and offline modes.\n\u2022 Developed and implemented an intuitive design taking into account the iOS User Interface \n\nguidelines and standards, as well as UI/UX expertise of the client\u2019s designer team.\n\u2022 Added the ability to share users\u2019 achievements with their friends via Facebook, Twitter, \n\nor email.\n\nValue Delivered\n\nAs SoftServe has vast expertise in mobile apps development, Vista Higher Learning \naddressed our company to create their language learning application from scratch. As \na result of the project, SoftServe designed multifunctional and fully tested mobile iOS \nand Android applications with user friendly and intuitive interface.

Shell is helping to meet the world\u2019s \ngrowing demand for energy in economically, environmentally, and socially responsible ways. \nIt produces more than 3 million barrels of oil equivalent per day and has over 40,000 service \nstations worldwide. Shell\u2019s New Energies business pursues two main areas of opportunities: \nnew fuels for transport, such as advanced biofuels, hydrogen, and charging for battery-\nelectric vehicles; and power, including low-carbon sources such as wind and solar as well as \nnatural gas.\n\nBusiness Challenge\n\nAfter having experienced a cybersecurity incident, Shell Retail reached out to SoftServe \nto implement a Cyber Attack Simulation and Protection service to evaluate the current \nsecurity posture and maturity of their IT organization. They decided to partner \nwith SoftServe for the company\u2019s 25 years of experience building secure solutions, \ncertifications success, and extensive expertise. SoftServe was asked to develop a plan to \nperform the following:\n\n\u2022 Application security assessments\n\u2022 Cloud security assessments (internal and external penetration testing) \n\u2022 Social engineering simulation attacks \n\nSHELL UNCOVERS CRITICAL \nSECURITY VULNERABILITIES \nTHROUGH A CYBER ATTACK \nSIMULATION\n\n\n\ncase study 2|    Shell uncovers critical security vulnerabilities through a cyber attack simulation\n\nProject Description\n\nThe cyber and social engineering attack simulation was conducted by the SoftServe team \nof certified ethical hackers, experts, and engineers. During the engagement, SoftServe\u2019s \nsecurity experts used best practices and the most advanced guidelines and standards, \nsuch as OWASP Top-10 Web Application Risks and the NIST Framework for Improving \nCritical Infrastructure Cybersecurity.\n\nDuring the engagement, SoftServe worked in close collaboration with Shell\u2019s internal IT \nteam and leadership, including the CIO.  \n\nSoftServe recommended a black-box approach for external perimeter penetration testing. \nBlack-box security testing is a method of software and infrastructure security testing in \nwhich the security controls, defenses and design of the infrastructure and applications are \ntested from the outside-in, with little or no prior knowledge of the application\u2019s internal \nworkings. Essentially, black-box testing takes an approach similar to that of a real attacker.\n\nSince black-box security testing does not assume or have knowledge of the target being \ntested, it is a technology independent method of testing. This makes it ideal for a variety \nof situations, particularly when testing for vulnerabilities that arise from deployment and \nconfiguration issues.\n\nIn addition, it offers the opportunity to encompass a wide test coverage with a very low \nfalse-positive rate when compared to other testing methodologies.\n\nBased on the black-box penetration testing, the process was divided into ten stages: \n\n1. Information gathering \n2. Target discovery \n3. Scanning and fingerprinting \n4. Segregation of targets \n5. Vulnerability identification \n6. Vulnerability analysis\n7. Penetration exploitation\n8. Impact analysis\n9. Mitigation strategies developments \n10. Reporting \n\nDuring this assessment following areas for testing were covered: \n\n\u2022 On-premises equipment and employees \n\u2022 Employee security and awareness \n\u2022 Internal IT infrastructure \n\u2022 Third party resources and providers \n\u2022 External network perimeter \n\u2022 Public facing web applications \n\n\n\ncase study 3|    Shell uncovers critical security vulnerabilities through a cyber attack simulation\n\nValue Delivered\n\nThe test uncovered a number of critical vulnerabilities that might have compromised \nsensitive data. The identified vulnerabilities were exploitable, and the risk posed was \nsignificant. SoftServe\u2019s security assessment helped Shell Retail prevent significant financial loss. \n\nWithin a short time span, SoftServe\u2019s team detected a range of defects and provided \nfar-reaching recommendations with regard to internal controls, applications, and \ninfrastructure.\n\nSoftServe\u2019s security experts defined the most effective approach to eliminate all the \nidentified vulnerabilities, improve key controls on external and internal infrastructure, and \neducate employees about security risks and the importance of testing internal security \npolicies and procedures regularly. \n\n\u201cSoftServe\u2019s team has the highest level of security expertise. \nAfter the security assessment which found critical \nvulnerabilities we decided to continue our collaboration to \nmitigate the risks.

The profiles needed to allow users to share detailed information about \ntheir skills, areas of interests, hobbies, etc. The client needed to develop this platform \nwith a limited budget and timeframe (4 months).\n\nThe key challenges included:\n\n\u2022 The ability to upload small video recordings\n\u2022 Strict timeframes and predefined release dates\n\u2022 Integration of a third-party video service.\n\nSOFTSERVE CREATES A SMART \nDATABASE TO MATCH GRADS WITH \nTHEIR PERFECT JOB\n\n\n\ncase study |   SoftServe Creates a Smart Database to Match Grads with their Perfect Job 2\n\nProject Description\n\nSoftServe\u2019s team for this project consisted of 4 developers, a quality assurance manager \nand a project manager. Considering the timing and budget, RoR (Ruby on Rails) was \nrecommended due to its functionalities and components. The RoR framework is constantly \ndeveloping and evolving so the client will not have trouble finding experienced staff to \nmaintain and expand the system. The RoR technology stack allowed SoftServe to speed-up \nthe development process and stay within the allotted timeframes and budget and reduce \nthe solution\u2019s time-to-market.\n\nAdditionally, the client agreed to use HireVue video/digital interviewing component as the \nfoundation for creating the video profiles. By introducing the proven and mature HireVue \ndigital interviewing solution, SoftServe not only accelerated the development of the core \nfeature of the system, but also ensured that the client will get access to new features that \nare regularly updated.\n\nThe SoftServe team held weekly meetings with the client to define requirements, make \nrecommendations, and determine next steps. This cadence of meetings  kept the client \ninformed and allowed the team to make decisions and change requirements based on the \nevolution of the project.\n\nValue Delivered\n\nSoftServe\u2019s successfully developed and implemented the web-based system - from \npre-development analysis to final deployment including a production environment with \nadditional monitoring and maintenance. The platform was launched in December 2013. \nCurrently the platform\u2019s goal is to gain as many users (both graduates and employers) as \npossible to continue the system\u2019s growth and evolution.\n\nThe benefits of the implemented platform include:\n\n\u2022 A database of graduate profiles (with videos) and employers\n\u2022 Automation of Resume/CV creation\n\u2022 Ability to search for the right candidate by specific search criteria\n\u2022 Secure communication with the right candidates and/or employers\n\u2022 Increased user satisfaction due to additional capabilities\n\u2022 Reduced time-to-market\n\n\n\nABOUT US\nSoftServe is a digital authority that advises and provides at the \ncutting-edge of technology.

The continuous development \nand complexity of information processing automation presupposes the \ndecisive role of security in information technology. 2015 was especially \nrich in cyber-attacks with companies such as T-Mobile, Kaspersky, and \nAnthem having had their security compromised and all sorts of personal \ninformation about users exposed.\n\nHaving a close look at the informational environment of any organization, \nit\u2019s not hard to see that applying traditional safety measures is a rather \nprohibitive approach, and often ineffective. Since there is a whole range of \npossible scenarios in a user\u2019s workflow within the security system, basic rules \nface multiple exceptions, reducing preventive protection and making the \nregular analysis of inner threats identification more complicated. Detecting \nexternal attacks is also becoming more and more problematic since attackers \nare aware of typical intrusion detection means and apply covert agents for \nthe attack. Here are main types of the network security breach: \n\nSecurity Violation\n\nScan DoS Attack Virus Attack Modification Traffic Analyzers\n\nFig. 2.  Network Security\n\nThese processes may be spotted, for instance, due to the increased activity \nof certain ports, new unusual services, changes in a user\u2019s work with \nnetwork resources, etc.\n\nOne possible solution to this problem is the development of systems that \nidentify unusual user network behavior, based on analysis of network \n\nhttp://www.cio.com/article/2857673/security/5-information-security-trends-that-will-dominate-2015.html\nhttp://www.forbes.com/sites/quora/2015/12/31/the-top-10-security-breaches-of-2015/\nhttp://www.forbes.com/sites/quora/2015/12/31/the-top-10-security-breaches-of-2015/\n\n\nwhite paper\n\nANOMALY DETECTION \u2013 UNSUPERVISED APPROACH 4\n\nactivity logs. Using data mining techniques, these systems reveal indicative \nbehavior patterns and draw conclusions about behavior that differs from \nwhat\u2019s considered conventional. The systems may though be self-adaptive, \nminimizing human involvement in configuring the system. Without taking \ninto account an organization\u2019s specifics, such systems are of particular \ninterest to specialists in the field of machine learning and data mining.\n\nIn this paper our Data Science Group (DSG) describes informational \nsecurity risk identification by detecting deviations from the typical pattern \nof network activity.\n\nAnomaly Detection \u2013 What\u2019s in a Name\n\nFollowing its etymology, an anomaly is any deviation from a rule. \nConsequently any violation of the standard behavior traced in historical \ndata can be interpreted as an anomaly. However, pattern violation \nmay be both known in advance and established as a result of analysis. \nIn this context, any problem related to the detection of non-standard \nbehavior leads to a search of the underlying condition (baseline) and the \nclassification of each event is recorded in the system as corresponding to \nor inconsistent with the found prototype.\n\nTalking about information security, this task may be accomplished \nby means of analyzing user activity and network equipment to detect \nirregular behavior in the external and internal network traffic (analysis \nof Netflow logs) which may serve as a signal of both internal activity and \nan attempted external attack. So, an anomaly is any event which may be \nestimated as statistically impossible in accordance with analysis results of the \nnetwork activity protocol. Here are three types of detected anomalies:  \n\n1. Significant deviation of the observed values from the expected value\n\n2. Failure in the process reflecting the change of the measured \nparameter within the surveillance area\n\n3. An atypical set of observed values in the measured parameters\n\nhttp://www.tripwire.com/state-of-security/security-data-protection/human-factors-effective-information-security-management-systems/\nhttp://www.cisco.com/c/dam/en/us/products/collateral/security/ios-network-foundation-protection-nfp/prod_presentation0900aecd80311f49.pdf\n\n\nwhite paper\n\nANOMALY DETECTION \u2013 UNSUPERVISED APPROACH 5\n\nStandard Netflow logs contain the following set parameters:\n\n1.

IP Type of Service\n\nInterpretation of the network protocol is not available here, so we don\u2019t \nhave information on which recorded events can be described as the norm, \nand which events are considered as a deviation. Therefore, to detect \nanomalies, the network activity protocol analysis should possess the \nfollowing features:\n\n1. Collection and storage of network activity results data\n\n2. Representation of network activity in the form of numerical \ncharacteristics series, supplemented by non-numeric attributes \n(qualifying factors), including time markers\n\n3.

The following metrics and measurement categories were \nused as the data source for constructing models:\n\n1. Total amount of \ntransferred data \nper time unit\n\n2. Total number \nof requests per \ntime unit\n\n1. Protocol type\n\n2. Source port\n\n3. Receiver port\n\n4. IP addresses group\n\nMetrics Category\n\nAccording to the anomaly types described above, we tried to combine \nthree different models: on one hand, to evaluate the nature of the metrics \nchange within different categories considering the accumulated data as \na process extended in time; on the other hand, to analyze the value of \nmetrics in different categories together for the isolated period of time.\n\n1. Dynamic Threshold Model allows an accepted level of assignment \n(measured value) to be set for specific time intervals (time of a day, \nweeks, months, etc.). Subsequently, each observed value is evaluated \nfor compliance with the threshold, making it possible to identify cases \nof the anomalies appearance. This model is a solution used to detect \nthe first type of anomalies.\n\n2. Association Rules Based Approach allows the activity of the network to \nbe described as an unrelated collection of events, and as a consequence, \npresenting it in the form of a stochastic process. Any event that is \ncharacterized by low probability can be interpreted as an anomaly.\n\n\n\nwhite paper\n\nANOMALY DETECTION \u2013 UNSUPERVISED APPROACH 7\n\n3. Time Series Clustering allows the identification of common \nregularities in the time series structure, capturing any deviation from \nthe established pattern at the same time (fitting the second type of \nanomalies).\n\nDynamic Threshold Model\n\nWhat lies at the heart of a Dynamic Threshold Model is representation of a \nuser\u2019s activity expressed as a set of measured parameter values (metrics) \nfor a certain observation category through a time series. It allows the \nestablishment of presence or absence of general tendencies that can be \nexpressed in the form of a general trend or have a seasonal character. For \nexample, we can consider a time series that reflects a week of network \nactivity of group members through the total amount of data transmitted in \none minute (Fig. 4). \n\nFig. 4. Time Series Example\n\n\n\nwhite paper\n\nANOMALY DETECTION \u2013 UNSUPERVISED APPROACH 8\n\nFig. 5. Flow of Anomaly Detection based on user activity\n\nThere is a common trend within this time section: through the week the \naverage user activity decreases. At the same time, the process cannot \nbe considered as proportional: there is a periodic sequence related to \nthe fact that the maximum and minimum activity fits in the middle of \nthe employees\u2019 work day and night-time correspondingly. In this way \neach day\u2019s activity can be described by a common pattern with minor \namendments from the primary trend. Then, user activity may be described \nin the form of a discrete time series (signal quantized in both time and \namplitude), along with evaluating a potential sampling error (allowed \ndeviation threshold) (fig. 5). If the replacement analogue signal with a \ndiscrete error exceeds the permitted deviation threshold, the situation can \nbe evaluated as an anomaly.\n\nThe next step is setting the maximum network load threshold for each part \nof the time series. The main reasoning behind this is to have average user \nactivity reflected in both series trending and seasonal components, with \nthe changes in load behavior taken into account.\n\n\n\nwhite paper\n\nANOMALY DETECTION \u2013 UNSUPERVISED APPROACH 9\n\nThe model shown allows the description of user activity in the network \nthrough a limited set of constants. This set can be obtained at the initial \nstage of system adjustment and doesn\u2019t require the entire set of historical \ndata analysis \u201con the fly\u201d to operate. \n\nIn addition, the model may be easily adapted to the changing process. If \nsignificant deviations of the discrete time series from the continuous one \nbecome more frequent, it is enough to merely adjust the threshold values \nand/or coefficients of the relative load.\n\nAssociation Rules based Model\n\nAs mentioned before, the process being monitored can be represented as \na set of linked events. Speaking about the activity of the user and/or group \nof users in the network, consider a single metric one-time value calculated \nfor the category and/or a several categorical variables combination. For \nexample, for sampling step time in 1 minute, estimate a total number of \ntransmitted packets by a department for 1 minute on a TCP/IP protocol \nin the first half of the work day and at the same time estimate the total \namount of packets via UDP protocol for the same user group.\n\nWe are not really interested in the absolute value of each of these \ncategories, but rather in the relative number of cases when this activity \nwas recorded.\n\nFor example, let\u2019s take a time series which reflects a needed parameter \n\nFig. 6.  Metric representation example\n\n\n\nwhite paper\n\nANOMALY DETECTION \u2013 UNSUPERVISED APPROACH 10\n\nchange in time. In most cases, the results of this measurement will be \npresented by a continuous variable, i.e. it takes an infinite number of \nvalues. Each value is unique within a quantization scale, which makes it \npossible to estimate the contribution of each individual observation in the \ncommon behavior pattern formation.\n\nFig. 7. Signal discretization\n\nHowever, it\u2019s not difficult to see that the measured value lies within certain \ndiscrete ranges, the sequence of which can be traced over time. Thanks to \nquantization, this fact facilitates shifting from a continuous representation \nto a discrete one. Limit the number of measured values by a finite set \nbreaking the entire values range to the equal density areas: \n\nTaking the time factor (T) into account, it becomes possible to allocate \nthose discrete random variable values that are highly unlikely for a specific \ntime line. So, in our example, the beginning and end of the working day \nare characterized by discrete random variable values from the set {6, 18, \n46}, while the range from 12:00 to 18:00 is characterized by a greater load: \n \n\n0.2 0.5 2 6 18 46 92 150 208 250\n\n0-6 0,42 0,17 0,17 0,17 0,07\n\n6-9 0,3 0,35 0,35\n\n9-12 0,14 0,43 0,38 0,05\n\n12-18 0,1 0,2 0,2 0,5\n\n18-21 0,35 0,45 0,2\n\n21-24 0,14 0,43 0,38 0,05\n\n\n\nwhite paper\n\nANOMALY DETECTION \u2013 UNSUPERVISED APPROACH 11\n\nWith this approach, the discrete random variable value (the analyzed \nparameter) defined by a small occurrence possibility within any time axis \narea (time slot) means getting out of the overall pattern, and consequently \n\u2013 the anomaly. Thus, for the time interval from 9:00 to 12:00 we get:\n\nSuch interpretation makes it possible to simultaneously analyze measured \nparameter values   for different categories; according to experimental \ndata it may be established that the value of one category suits for \nadjusting metric values   for the other. This means that there are common \ncombinations of values   in both categories. In this case, the information \nenhances certain pattern value. The more categories a frequent \ncombination combines, the higher the detecting pattern probability in the \nobserved process is, and the higher the deviation from it appears.\n\nLet\u2019s say, as based on the results of observations within one month, the \nfollowing activity was recorded in two different settings (M1 and M2):\n\nFig 8. Possible value boundaries\n\nFig 9. Observation results for two metrics\n\n\n\nwhite paper\n\nANOMALY DETECTION \u2013 UNSUPERVISED APPROACH 12\n\nDependence between individual values   of the observed value can be \nrepresented as a graph, where nodes are random events (system\u2019s state). \nEach event corresponds to a certain metric value or combination of several \nvalues,   and link weights reflect their conditional probabilities (Fig. 10 \n-left). As seen in the graph, the system behavior is described by a pattern \nset that can be found in each observation (system\u2019s state). This graph \ncan be simplified by means of small weight connection leveling and path \nreduction with a low total weight (Fig. 10 -right). As a result, we get a set of \nrules that define normal system behavior. \n\nThe problem of obtaining user activity patterns in the network faces the \nproblem of detecting associative links between individual states of the \nsystem described above, which form associative rules that describe the \nrequired patterns. This approach makes it possible to use known methods \nof mining association rules in order to recreate the average user activity, in \nparticular the Apriory algorithm. \n\nFig. 10. Stochastic Model \n\n\n\nwhite paper\n\nANOMALY DETECTION \u2013 UNSUPERVISED APPROACH 13\n\nEach of the rules selected is a component of the required user behavior \npattern: the bigger the number of rules for observation gets, the more \nsignificant the pattern may be considered, and the more likely it will \ncharacterize the expected behavior standard. As the observation rank, we \nused a normalized meaning of the weighted rules taking into account their \nlift, rule\u2019s performance at predicting cases measured against a random \nchoice. So for this example, we get:\n\nM1=<0.6) -> (M2 in [22, 30))\n\n(M1>154) -> (M2 in [14, 18))\n\n(M1>154) -> (M2 in [18, 22)))\n\n(M1 in [7, 46)) -> (M2 in [22, 30))\n\n(M1 in [0.6, 7)) -> (M2 in [14, 18))\n\n(M1 in [0.6, 7)) -> (M2 in [22, 30))\n\n(M1>154) -> (M2 in [22, 30))\n\n(M1>154) -> (M2>30))\n\n(M1 in [7, 46)) -> (M2>30))\n\n(M1>154) -> (M2<14)\n\n(M1=<0.6) -> (M2 in [18, 22)))\n\n(M1 in [7, 46)) -> (M2<14)\n\n(M1 in [46, 154)) -> (M2<14)\n\nM1=<0.6\n\nM1 in [0.6, 7)\n\nM1 in [7, 46)\n\nM1 in [46, 154)\n\nM1>154\n\nM2<14\n\nM2 in [14, 18)\n\nM2 in [18, 22)\n\nM2 in [22, 30)\n\nM2>30\n\n(M1 in [0.6, 7)) -> M2 in [18, 22))\n\nM1 in [46, 154)) -> (M2>30)\n\n(M1=<0.6) -> M2 in [14, 18))\n\n0\n,0\n\n0\n0\n\n0\n,0\n\n50\n0\n\n,1\n0\n\n0\n0\n\n,1\n50\n\n0\n,2\n\n0\n0\n\n0\n,2\n\n50\n0\n\n,3\n0\n\n0\n0\n\n,3\n50\n\n0\n,4\n\n0\n0\n\nFig. 11.  Rules importance\n\n\n\nwhite paper\n\nANOMALY DETECTION \u2013 UNSUPERVISED APPROACH 14\n\nThe lower the observation rank, the more reasons there are to believe that \nit is covered by the definition of anomaly.\n\nThe developed model allows several factors to be taken into account in \nassessing user activity, as well as describing it as a finite rules set, each of \nwhich is characterized by a certain level of significance in the found patterns \nsystem. Similar to the previous model, it can be used to analyze the process \nonline, and adapted to the changing process due to the revaluation of the \ndetected rules weight and/or by means of adding new ones. \n\nTime Series Clustering\n\nThe last model is based on the time series partition method which allows a \nset to be presented as a discrete segments ensemble that forms separated \ngroups (clusters) defined by the fact that time series components from the \nsame cluster are close to each other, while the fragments from different \nclusters are distinct. Here\u2019s an example of time series analysis:\n\n \n \nLine fragments highlighted in green have more in common than a red-\ncontoured one. In this case, they may be referenced to one group. To \nestimate the time series proximity degree (similarity), it is possible to \nuse a timeline dynamic transformation algorithm (DTW) which facilitates \nthe finding of optimal conformance by using time series fragments. \nThis method was used in speech recognition. The process of time series \nsegmentation presupposes formation of fragments plurality from this \nline by passing it with a floating window of a given size and with a certain \nsampling interval.\n\nFig 12.  Time series fragments similarity\n\n\n\nwhite paper\n\nANOMALY DETECTION \u2013 UNSUPERVISED APPROACH 15\n\nIn general terms, Fig. 13 depicts the basic process of the model in \nquestion, i.e. detection of the time series abnormal dynamics. \n\nThe result of the pairwise comparison of the obtained fragments through \na DW-distance evaluation forms the adjacency matrix which reflects the \nproximity degree between the fragments. The obtained matrix may be \nused as a basis for solving the issue of fragments clusterization.\n\nThe clusterization result of the first 13,000 minutes (80%) for three metrics \n(countInputUDP, countInputTCP and averagePacketSizeOutputUDP) is shown \nin the figure below. Fragments of the time series are displayed in the space \nof two principal components, while different colors distinguish components \n\nFig 13.  Abnormal dynamics detecting process\n\nFig 14.  Clusters representation\n\n\n\nwhite paper\n\nANOMALY DETECTION \u2013 UNSUPERVISED APPROACH 16\n\nfrom different clusters. In each case a single large cluster is formed out of the \ntime series fragments that constitute a common behavior pattern. Clusters of \nsmall size can be interpreted as an anomaly.\n\nClusters with small amounts of components are related to dynamics \nchanges, which isn\u2019t typical for the majority of cases. The level of these \ndeviations abnormality depends on a relevant set power. At the same time, \nthe significance of anomaly in a certain period of time can be determined \nby the number of metrics that were analyzed to identify the period.\n\nThe obtained model allows network activity to be estimated through \nthe dynamics of the measured parameter changes and/or measured \nparameters system, which may help identify abnormality even if the \nabsolute values lie within acceptable ranges. The only drawback it poses is \nthe complexity of usage \u201con the fly\u201d because its implementation requires \ncalculation of the similarity degree of the new observations with the \nexisting clusters elements.\n\nModels Ensemble\n\nTo maximize the effectiveness of the models used for the information \nsecurity violations detection, our Data Science Group decided to unite them \ninto one ensemble (Fig. 15). As seen from the diagram, the first two models \n(Dynamic Thresholds and Association Rules) use the same data set related to \nmeasurements according to N categories received in real time. This approach \nmay be referred to a begging model where the role of arbiter is performed \nby an Anomaly Confidence Level unit reestablishing the level of certainty that \nabnormal network activity takes place in the given time period. Meanwhile, \nthe Time Series Clustering model works with the pool of historical data which \npresupposes its inclusion in the model according to the boosting method. \n\nBecause of the differing usage modes between the models (online \nand offline), the model-based time series segmentation is the most \napplicable in non-business hours to clarify the situation when an \nanomaly hasn\u2019t been detected. According to the offline verification \nresults and further verification, the models are to be adjusted to the \n\n\n\nwhite paper\n\nANOMALY DETECTION \u2013 UNSUPERVISED APPROACH 17\n\nnew conditions, which leads to a change in a range of normal behavior \npatterns and, as a consequence, allows the observed process to be \ndescribed with more accuracy. \n\nMetrics\n\nPattern \nDatabase\n\nTime Series \nClustering\n\nVerification\n\nNormal \nBehavior\n\nAnomaly \nBehavior\n\nDynamic \nThreshold\n\nAssociation \nRules\n\nN\n\nN\n\nN\n\nAnomaly \nConfidence \nLevel1\n\nFig 15.  Ensemble of models\n\nConclusions \n\nWithin the framework of the conducted research, our Data Science Group \ncame up with a comprehensive solution to detect differing network activity \nof users or group of users as opposed to a well-known pattern, which in its \nturn may indicate attempts of an information security breach. The offered \nsolution is an ensemble of three models that facilitate analysis of three \nanomaly types:\n\n1. Significant deviation of the observed values from the expected \u2013 \nDynamic Threshold Model. Simplicity in implementation and its ease \nof adaptation are the main advantages of the model; on the other \nhand, the isolation of the analysis results for each individual metric \nfrom observations in other categories appears to be its downside, \nwhich makes it difficult to search for event patterns.\n\n\n\nwhite paper\n\nANOMALY DETECTION \u2013 UNSUPERVISED APPROACH 18\n\n2. Unusual set of the observed values of the measured parameters \u2013 \nAssociation Rules Based Model. The main advantage of this model is \nits ability to describe the observed process as a set of related events; \ninsensitivity to weak process dynamic changes is its main drawback.\n\n3. Unusual dynamics in the observed process \u2013 Time Series Clustering \nModel. Even though the found patterns in this model reflect the \ninternal dynamics of the observed process, it doesn\u2019t allow detection \nof event patterns and its application \u201con the fly\u201d is extremely difficult. \n\nThis is why we suggest using an ensemble model, since combined they \nneutralize all the disadvantages and facilitate decision-making regarding \nadaptation to the modified conditions. As a result, this solution allows \nboth typical abnormal network activity manifestations to be identified and \nunusual and new elements of the network anomalies to be detected, while \nthe self-adjusting capability lets the solution adapt to the \u201clegal\u201d changes in \nthe network processes.\n\n\n\nwhite paper\n\nANOMALY DETECTION \u2013 UNSUPERVISED APPROACH 19\n\nTetiana Gladkikh is a Data Scientist at SoftServe.

The possibility of conducting \ncomplex transactions with unprecedented efficiency, security, and trust is tantalizing. \nBut what can blockchain or digital ledger technology (DLT) do for your business, today?\n\nFear of Missing Out? \n\nTrending aside, there is ample reason to be excited about the technology behind the \ncurtain. According to IDC, $945 million was spent on blockchain solutions in 2017, and \nthe interest and investments are growing. Still nascent in its development, application, and \nacceptance, DLT and its impact on specific businesses and industries could be profound. \nSome industries stand to gain more than others, so businesses need to explore where the \npossibilities lie, and whether they can benefit from it. So where to begin? \n\nBusinesses that join an ecosystem that adopts DLT stand to gain from some unique \ncharacteristics pertaining to three critical business needs: security, zero knowledge proof, \nand efficiency. In the daily course of business, many companies have already satisfied one \nor another of these needs, perhaps even two. But DLT changes everything, because the very \nstructure of DLT necessitates that all three\u2014security, zero knowledge proof, and efficiency\u2014\nare always present across the ecosystem.\n\nFor example, in an industry such as commodities trading that is heavily reliant upon \npaperwork, moving to a DLT-supported digital system will provide many benefits. It will \nstreamline processes (less paper means greater efficiency), minimize the risk of forged \ndocuments (which, at times, can be worth millions of dollars), and provide greater security \nand zero knowledge proof, thanks to the mechanism through which transactions are \nconfirmed and recorded.\u00a0 \n\nDLT, Defined \n\nMost businesses rely on ledgers of various kinds to account for their transactions. In \nfact, business\u2019 checking account is essentially a ledger maintained by your bank. With \nDLT, ledgers are no longer unique to each participant, but rather exist as one database, \nshared among multiple participants and across varied locations. By removing the \nintermediary who controls the ledger, the process of decentralization and distribution \nallows for all participants to view and confirm transactions.\u00a0 \n\nhttps://www.idc.com/tracker/showproductinfo.jsp?prod_id=1842\n\n\nwhitepaper | Will DLT Work for My Business? 3\n\n\u00a0\n\nThanks to this simple principle of decentralization, transactions can now be confirmed via \nconsensus among participants before being \u201cetched\u201d into the ledger. Blockchain, a form of a \ndistributed ledger, is differentiated by its compiling of those transactions into blocks, which \nform a chain on the open ledger. Confirmation or consensus for each transaction can result \nin a token; the most recognizable is Bitcoin, the cryptocurrency that utilizes blockchain. \nHowever, tokens do not have to take the form of a new currency, but can be representative \nof a standardized fee or some physical aspect unique to the consortium. Creating a \nconsortium utilizing DLT simplifies the way transactions take place in revolutionary ways.\u00a0 \n\nAdvantage DLT \n\nFor businesses, security is paramount. Forgery, data theft, and cybercrimes can have a \ncrippling impact on business. What makes DLT so secure is the process through which \ntransactions are confirmed and recorded. For every transaction, participants (nodes) \nhave to reach consensus, achieved through complex mathematical algorithms. The \nlarger the network, the more times the transaction is confirmed, the more nodes on the \nnetwork retain a copy of the transaction, the harder it is for any alterations to be made \nafter the fact. In a decentralized system, there is no single point of failure. The system \nas a whole is nearly impossible to hack, and the loss of one node will not undermine \nthe integrity of the system itself.\u00a0 \n\nHow can one be sure that what is being asked is what is being received? It can be hard \nto have trust without zero knowledge proof, and a prerequisite of confirmation through \nconsensus is zero knowledge proof. So how is this zero knowledge proof achieved? Every \nnode keeps copies of the ledger, making transactions visible, traceable, and immutable. \nWith every transaction visible, every participant is verifiable.\n\n\n\nwhitepaper | Will DLT Work for My Business? 4\n\nIn industries where provenance is essential, being able to see the source and cycle of a \nproduct is crucial. It means that when a rubber company wants to know that its rubber is \nsourced from farms that use sustainable practices, or when a grocer wants to know that he\u2019s \nbuying vegetables that are organic or fruit that hasn\u2019t sat too long in the harbor, an open \nledger provides the ability to track such information. The lifecycle of a product can now be \ncompletely visible from the producer to the local aggregator, the packager, all the way to the \nend-user. Simultaneously, visibility provides a truthful representation of the marketplace, \nenabling fairer pricing and thus a more accurate representation of product value.\u00a0 \n\nIt seems the world keeps moving faster and faster, putting greater emphasis and \nvalue on efficiency. Legacy systems, a reliance on paper, conflicting processes, and \ndependency on third-party verification are but a few examples of hindrances many \nindustries and businesses face.\u00a0 \n\nWith DLT, efficiencies are gained in myriad ways. In addition to addressing the \naforementioned problems, smart contracts can be set to execute upon the meeting of \nlogical conditions, tokens can be standardized as a form of payment, and settlements \ncan be resolved with less human input. Being part of a DLT consortium brings the value \nof streamlined and consistent processes, enabling businesses to focus on growth, \nservices, and other deliverables.\n\n\n\nwhitepaper | Will DLT Work for My Business? 5\n\nThese are not easy questions to answer, and each factor has several underlying \nconsiderations. Even if a process needs restructuring, shifting from legacy systems to an \nopen ledger will have up-front costs that need to be taken into account. If a consortium \nexists, a hybrid of public and private DLT structures, is it critical that all participants have \nshared interests? If an ecosystem is already utilizing DLT for certain processes, what are \nthe opportunities for scaling and leveraging that system?\u00a0 \n\nAt SoftServe, we understand how to balance the desire for innovation with the need \nfor practical solutions. Certain industries are ripe for DLT. For example, we are actively \nexploring DLT applications in the commodities trading sector, in financial services, and in a \nwide range of other industries. Creating a digital ecosystem and leveraging the tokenized \nsystem will enable the optimization and acceleration of products and services while \nproviding security and zero knowledge proof.\u00a0 \n\nWe understand what business questions to ask.

Nevertheless, each business has unique \nneeds, and each industry has distinct characteristics which may or may not benefit\nfrom committing to DLT.\n\nFor businesses wondering if they should invest, there are several factors that need to be \nconsidered:\n\n\u2022 What specific business or market processes need restructuring? \n\u2022 Is there an existing ecosystem that can be leveraged? \n\u2022 If so, who are the participants?\u00a0 \n\u2022 How is it organized? \n\u2022 Are the circumstances and conditions ripe to lead the way?\n\nhttps://www.softserveinc.com/en-us/contact/\n\n\nABOUT US\nSoftServe is a global digital authority and consulting company, operating \nat the cutting edge of technology.

Some may call that ironic, \nconsidering the fate of \u201crelics\u201d such as Nexus\u2014which gave us \u201cwww\u201d\u2014and floppy disks, \nboth considered cutting edge technology only two decades ago. The historical pursuit of \nimproved experiences through technological advancement is well documented, but it\u2019s \nbeing accomplished more quickly, efficiently, and intelligently today than ever before.\n\nIt\u2019s time to set aside resistance to change and embrace it \nintelligently, or risk being left behind.\n\nHow did we get here? \n\nIt wasn\u2019t long ago that personal computers shook the foundations of the global market. \nBut besides the advent of personal computers, the most recent significant change on the \nmarket happened with the arrival of the first smartphone. Smartphones placed integrated, \nhigh-demand, and highly personal experiences into users\u2019 hands\u2014a massive leap forward \nfrom their PDA, flip phone, and pager predecessors. And with a multitude of apps at their \ndisposal, users were able to tailor their smartphones according to their wants and needs. \n\nAs application delivery expanded to mobile, wearables, and systems that \u201clearn,\u201d users \nbegan engaging wherever and whenever they wanted with social media, entertainment, \nhealth and fitness, finances, and beyond. And it wasn\u2019t long before businesses and \nsolution providers began rethinking how the customer could interact with these devices.\u00a0 \n\nThrough seamlessly embedded and connected technology\u2014such as internet of things (IoT), \nbiometric authentication, and the cloud\u2014smart environments began leveraging device, \ntouch, voice, and visual interactions to give users a more intuitive, immersive experience. \n\nIn parallel, users became accustomed to, and then demanded, personalized experiences.\u00a0\n\nFar from the personal computers of old, modern interfaces have evolved from reactive to \ninteractive. As data is collected, the experience is enhanced. And as artificial intelligence \nand machine learning elevate the ability to interact with the user, \u201ccomputers\u201d are \ntransforming into a variety of cutting-edge interfaces that change our day-to-day lives.\n\n\n\nwhitepaper | The Future of Intelligent Personalization 3\n\nWhere we are today \n\nIn 2018, thanks to computational power, big data, and device connectivity, we now \nhave the ability to process significant amounts of information. Combined with artificial \nintelligence and advances made in speech recognition (which allows machines to \nunderstand language) applications can learn from experience so that one can talk with a \ndevice with ease and simplicity. And with virtual assistants, voice commands are becoming \na regular part of our daily lives.\u00a0 \n\nThese advancements in voice are paving the way for conversational commerce. \nConversational commerce is about shifting from a storefront-like experience towards a \nsimple chat interface. This shift allows for a one-to-one communication channel with the \ncustomer. Users interact with the store just as if they were with a sales person\u2014only the \nsales person is, in fact, a bot.\u00a0 \n\nPlatforms like conversational commerce respond to the individual user, recognizing \nunique patterns and behaviors in an attempt to predict next actions or reactions.

But a major problem is on the \nhorizon for many DLT solutions: scalability. Many DLT solutions came about without an \nend-game or a goal in mind, and simply grew. Take Bitcoin, a cryptocurrency reliant on \nDLT\u2019s blockchain. Bitcoin, for all of its popularity, was not made for scalability, and as its \npopularity has grown, its speed has lagged considerably. For example, while the Visa \nnetwork is capable of handling 24,000 transactions per second, the Bitcoin network is \nlimited to approximately five.\n\nPart of this problem stems from a lack of predictability within the given DLT structure. After \nall, how can one predict the direction of a solution that is built, quite literally, block by block?\n\nBut, while evasive for many, creating a scalable DLT solution is possible.\n\nIn this white paper, we will address solving problems of scalability within DLT solutions \nby using agent-based modeling as a predictive tool. \n\nApplications for DLT\n\nThere are many applications for DLT, from identity protection and security, to real-time \npayments and banking interoperability. The primary benefit of DLT is its immutable \nstorage, which keeps records transparent and unchangeable. DLT is efficient and \ntransparent. It enables new (distributed) functionalities and removes the need for a third \nparty. Additionally, cryptocurrencies or tokens are used for payments, facilitating various \ntransactions and automatically covering the cost of system maintenance.\n\nBut even with all the benefits that DLT has to offer, too often scalability is missing. What \nhappens when the network grows? Can the infrastructure keep up with the demand?\n\nTo ensure the network is sustainable, businesses should start with the end goal in mind \nand work backwards. When too much focus is placed on the immediate mechanics of \nindividual transactions and network participants, businesses often fail to recognize \nhow these solutions will evolve. And disregarding the long-term outlook causes a larger \nproblem as interactions become increasingly complex.\n\nLong-term predictability can be difficult to achieve without the right knowledge, and self-\norganization may lead to the sudden collapse of the entire network.\n\nHow can a business ensure long-term scalability with DLT? The answer is\nagent-based modeling.\n\nAgent-based modeling \n\nAgent-based modeling (ABM) is a powerful simulation modeling methodology that has \nexisted for decades but applying it to DLT is a relatively new concept.\n\n\n\nwhitepaper | DLT 2.0: It's All About Scalability 3\n\nABM leverages reverse engineering. However, on a higher level, it provides a detailed \nsimulation of the business ecosystem. The simulation is composed of a collection of \nautonomous decision-making entities called agents which interact via a prescribed set of \nrules. For various systems, these agents are formed from a variety of groups as diverse as \nentire households, institutional investors, and even individual customers.\n\nABM accommodates a wider range of developing behavior than conventional models. \nIt provides a natural description of a system, linking the behavior of individual agents \ntogether to deliver results that are comprehensive and dynamic rather than linear and \nstatic. ABM is flexible and proven to deal with emergent phenomena in a number of \nscientific areas. As a result, it is used by more and more businesses.\n\nThe application of ABM to DLT to simulate scalability is a natural step. Agent-based \nmodeling relies on looking at larger, dynamic patterns of the way different components \ninteract, producing simulations that are very near to real outcomes. \n\nWith this kind of complex analytical capability:\n\n\u2022 Predictability becomes more sophisticated.\n\u2022 Individual agents, possible transactions, and strategies are well-defined as nodes on\n\nthe blockchain.\n\u2022 Actions are discrete and the system becomes naturally scalable.\n\n\n\nwhitepaper | DLT 2.0: It's All About Scalability 4\n\nSimulating a business network and all transactions at a larger scale allows for checking \nongoing stability and efficiency. This means businesses can avoid the surprising collapses \nand unpredictable events that are common with DLTs that have not considered the \nlongterm implications of growth.\n\nThere are two facets of ABM simulations: \n\n\u2022 Discrete event simulations that model step-by-step transactions in the DLT, and\n\u2022 Object-oriented programming that models every participant on the network as an\n\nobject, each having properties and methods to interact with the environment.\n\nThen it\u2019s a matter of utilizing insights from statistics, behavioral economics, game theory, \nand artificial intelligence to make the behavior of the \"agents\" in the simulation as close to \nreal life as possible.\n\nProceed with caution\n\nWith such great capabilities, why isn\u2019t ABM always applied to DLT structures?\n\nFirst, the complexity of a successful DLT structure implemented through ABM rests on \ntechnological expertise. Despite the value of the methodology, the applicable expertise \nto implement it is a rare commodity, worldwide. Navigating the nuances of DLT through \nABM relies on an advanced knowledge across a spectrum of fundamental disciplines, \nincluding statistical physics or bioinformatics.\n\nAt SoftServe, our PhD-level experts are top in their field, with connections \nto top academic groups. This allows us to deliver effective ABM-driven DLT \nsolutions for our clients.\n\nFinancial services managers should also consider the importance of setting expectations \nand carrying out due diligence to drive the ultimate solution. While this may seem obvious, \nextra care should be taken due to the nature of DLT structure, supporting platforms and \ntechnologies, and approach to ensure all parties have the same achievable goal in mind. The \nlack of a fixed goal or trajectory is often why DLT solutions fail, a point that cannot be \noveremphasized. This is why ABM is so crucial. To avoid financial and functionality risks it is \ncrucial to test and prove, rather than to make assumptions in strategy, design, and planning.\n\n1.\n2.\n\n\n\nwhitepaper | DLT 2.0: It's All About Scalability 5\n\nSet of rules and\ninitial parameters.\n\nABM\n\nOptimal set of\nrules and\n\nparameters.\n\nLet\u2019s review DLT in action in two SoftServe case studies:\n\nCommodity Trading\n\nCommodity trading depends on managing a complex system of letters of credit between \ncounterparties, which is costly and extremely time-consuming. SoftServe\u2019s work with one \nclient in particular proved the sustainability and scalability as the commodity exchange \ngrew. \n\nThe client used blockchain to alleviate information asymmetry and the cost of transaction\n\u2014the leading causes of trade finance gaps. The solution has a number of benefits. The \nDLT-based platform is an alternative to the conventional method of using letters of \ncredit within commodity financing. Eliminating letters of credit only requires a nominal \ncommission for the transaction and reduces management time. \n\nUltimately, the solution means trades can be executed more quickly. Commodity \ntrading can be constrained by time if the commodity has to be delivered at a particular date. \nIf the letter of credit cycle is too long, the trade will not happen\u2014DLT resolves this issue.\n\nConsidering the number of institutional investors and variously-sized enterprises, scaling the \nentire ecosystem is advantageous to all parties. Yet scaling has to be stable and predictable. \nThe solution was to use ABM to study and assess transaction loads and ensure the \nscalability of the financial ecosystem.\n\nDLT also increases availability. Banks tend to focus more on high-volume borrowers due to \nregulatory requirements. As a result, small import/export firms can experience difficulty \naccessing financing via traditional methods. DLT creates a bridge to a larger number of firms \nof various sizes, opening the gateway for new business in a scalable format.\n\nFORECAST \n\nLong-term viability \n\n\n\nwhitepaper | DLT 2.0: It's All About Scalability 6\n\nAdjoint\n\nThe possibilities of DLT aren\u2019t limited to commodity trading. ABM-based DLT is applicable \nacross the spectrum of financial services business, from transactions to loans, to \ninsurance. A working model allows for the detailed understanding of all aspects of a \nprojected system. The model includes insights on the possibilities of the system, the \ninvestigation of the optimal set of rules and transactions, and the discovery of dynamics \nand critical events in various stress scenarios.\n\nSoftServe partnered with Adjoint to apply this methodology, accelerating automation \nthrough smart contracts to improve transactional privacy and security. Adjoint\u2019s Uplink is \nan open-source platform designed to quickly deploy, maintain, verify, and execute smart \ncontracts globally on a private, permission-based distributed ledger. SoftServe works with \nAdjoint to help customers assimilate and on-board the Uplink platform effectively.\n\nBy using smart contracts fueled by blockchain, the platform helps propel the development of \ndomain-specific distributed applications to reduce costs, mitigate risks, and improve margins.\n\nScale for the future\n\nABM ensures scalable DLT. Through complex simulations, ABM-based DLT structures \nare able to predict immeasurable scenarios that feed into the overall value of the ledger, \nreducing surprises while promoting system sustainability. By moving beyond linear \npredictions, ABM intuitively models nonlinear and chaotic behaviors at the individual agent \nlevel. This benefit carries a considerable amount of value.

If \nproviders pursue improved outcomes, they typically face higher costs. If they work to \nlower costs, then patient care tends to suffer. In today\u2019s digital economy, this modus \noperandi need not apply. It is possible for healthcare administrators to achieve outstanding \nquality of care via scalable technologies while still maintaining cost. \n\nThe record suggests that despite significant investments in healthcare IT, including \n$37 billion spent in incentive payments by the US Federal Government\u2019s Medicare and \nMedicaid Services alone between 2011 and 2017, most organizations are enduring more \npain than gain as they work to integrate new IT systems with their operations. Efforts \nto persuade providers and other organizations to share information continue to lag, as \ndo efforts to enable different IT systems to communicate with one another, leaving data \nisolated in siloed databases. \n\nA recent survey published in the Harvard Business Review regarding the need for \ntransformative change in health care IT concludes:\n\n\u201c\u2026the impact of IT on reducing the costs and improving the quality of clinical care \nhas been modest... Relatively few organizations have taken the important next step \nof analyzing the wealth of data in their IT systems to understand the effectiveness \nof the care they deliver... instead of viewing IT as a transactional tool for billing, \nmonitoring, and error checking, organizations should embrace it as an instrument to \nhelp transform the way they deliver health care.\u201d\n\nThe current obstacles are clear. Today\u2019s IT infrastructure and systems across health \ncare tend to be rigid, difficult to change, and expensive to update with the latest clinical \nprotocols. Different systems cannot share information, making it practically impossible \nto create health records with a patient\u2019s complete medical history, much less make those \nrecords available to clinicians from diverse healthcare organizations. \n\nWithout information sharing, it is difficult to pool data, and nearly impossible to harness \nthe latest innovations in predictive analytics to guide clinical and operational decisions. \nEnabling an organization to do all of those would go a long way in addressing the trade-off \nbetween care and cost. Yet still, healthcare administrators from all sides of the industry \nremain reluctant to embrace more agile technology to period.\n\nWhen faced with the classic tradeoff between care vs. cost, pioneers across the healthcare \nindustry are discovering that there is a better way.\n\nThe operational opportunities that flow from migration to the cloud are already apparent \nand profound today. More importantly, the cloud is becoming foundational for healthcare \nsystems of the future. Value-based pricing, evidence-based medicine, community health \nmanagement and other universal objectives are becoming increasingly complex at the \nspeed of digital, and the coming healthcare ecosystem will inevitably gravitate toward \nthose organizations that make the move to the cloud, building better care while capturing \nmore actionable insights and lower costs.\n\nhttps://hbr.org/2017/11/the-it-transformation-health-care-needs\nhttps://hbr.org/2017/11/the-it-transformation-health-care-needs\n\n\nwhitepaper | Elevating Healthcare with the Cloud 3\n\nThe Cloud is on the rise\n\nCloud adoption in the healthcare industry has accelerated over the last few years and \nwill keep growing. According to one estimate, the global healthcare cloud computing \nmarket is forecasted to triple from 2015 to 2020, eventually reaching $9.48 billion. \nGartner predicts that by 2021, public cloud service providers will process more than 35% \nof healthcare providers\u2019 IT workloads.\n\nCost benefits are among the biggest advantages of moving to the cloud environment, in part \nbecause of the inherent efficiency of cloud-based computing, and in part because working in \nthe cloud makes it much easier to collect and work with the vast quantities of structured and \nunstructured data from diverse sources that characterize healthcare operations today. \n\nAssets such as medical imagery, open notes files, financial PDFs, and monitoring device \ndata are difficult to interface, yet are often collected and stored in the same location \ntoday. Unraveling these data knots within current IT systems is time-consuming and \nexpensive. Migrating data to the cloud opens superior new options for integration, \nanalysis, and predictive analytics.\n\nMigration is not without its challenges, which makes informed choices about choosing \nthe right cloud provider and overall implementation plan critical. The following is an \nexample of a healthcare leader making the move to the AWS Cloud and discovering that \nit is possible to simultaneously improve care, reduce costs, and evolve healthcare for the \nfuture.\n\nHealthcare success on the Cloud \n\nCase study 1\n\nMEDHOST\u00ae, a provider of enterprise, departmental, and healthcare engagement solutions \nto more than 1,100 healthcare facilities, set out to develop a new solution aimed at \nautomating and simplifying patient- and provider-related tasks and communications. \n\nThe goal was to provide patients and caregivers with online access to personal health \nrecords for easier, faster interaction with healthcare providers. MEDHOST partnered with \nSoftServe to create the new platform, \u201cYourCareCommunity,\u201d using a micro-service \narchitecture for a cloud-based portal on Amazon Web Services (AWS). \n\nThe AWS environment made it possible to build a comprehensive consumer relationship \nmanagement solution with multifaceted analytics fully integrated on a cloud data exchange \nplatform.

Executives think we are in the \u2018Golden Age of Content\u2019 with larger \nbudgets, more talent, and more opportunities to reach audiences. Consumption now \noccurs across multiple devices in many locations. Broadcasters have rolled out their own \nover-the-top (OTT) streaming services and, in some cases, are now looking to launch their \nown premium direct-to-consumer (D2C) services. They are experimenting with virtual \nreality, customisable interactive content, 8K HDR viewing, hyper-personalisation, and \nautomatic filming. In terms of content, European broadcasters have had a global impact, \ntoo, with successes including Killing Eve, Broadchurch, Deutschland \u201983, The Bridge, and \nSpiral.\n\nHowever, the landscape is changing. International subscription video-on-demand (SVOD) \nservices, dominated by American giants such as Netflix and Amazon, continue to capture \nviewing share, with SVOD use rising 22% year-on-year in the UK2. Audience behaviour \nis shifting towards on-demand content, with many 16-24-year olds turning to these \nservices first, rather than linear channels3. Disney, Time Warner, NBCU, and Apple have \nall announced streaming services. Facebook and YouTube are producing and distributing \ncontent through proprietary platforms, and Amazon and Twitter are purchasing sports \nrights. These companies, often born in Silicon Valley, are data-first and digitally native. \nThey do not have cumbersome legacy platforms to maintain; and innovating through \ntechnology is in their DNA.\n\nHow can European broadcasters respond to these challenges? What are some of the key \npain point facing European broadcasters today as they seek to transform their businesses? \nWhat areas of innovation should European broadcasters focus on? How can the video \nvalue chain benefit from new technologies on the horizon, including artificial intelligence \n(AI) and machine learning (ML)? What other innovation imperatives exist for European \nbroadcasters? Who is best placed to deliver the solutions required?\n\nMTM has partnered with SoftServe, digital advisors and providers who operate at the \ncutting edge of technology, to explore the issues facing European broadcasters, and the \ntypes of innovation required for them to compete.\n\nWhat do we \nmean by \n\ninnovation?\n\nInnovation is about creating a \nculture of constant change\n\nInnovation is identifying \nspecific problems and pain \n\npoints facing a business\n\nInnovation is developing new \ndata supported products, \n\nservices and business models\n\nInnovation needs to return \nvalue to the enterprise - in \n\nterms of sustainability and ROI\n\n\n\nwhitepaper | Solving European broadcasters\u2019 pain points 3\n\nExhibit 2: Potential pain points in the video value chain\n\nContent Management \n& Distribution\n\nDelivering videos from \ndifferent locations \n\nacross multiple devices\n\nAudience Engagement \n& Monetisation\n\nEnsuring helghtened \nvideo experienced and \n\noptimised monetisation\n\nContent \nCreation\n\nProduction of videos \nfrom concept  \n\nto editing\n\n\u2022 Ad insertion and \nmanagement\n\n\u2022 Personalisation and \nanalytics\n\n\u2022 Customer \noperations\n\n\u2022 Content marketing\n\nSource: MTM analysis\n\nEUROPEAN BROADCASTERS FACE CHALLENGES \nIN THREE KEY STAGES OF THE VIDEO VALUE \nCHAIN\nFrom speaking to industry participants, we identified three critical stages of the video \nvalue chain where European broadcasters must look to innovative technologies in order to \nrespond to new challenges:\n\nThis video workflow value chain surfaces multiple pain points for broadcasters. Many \nof these areas present complex challenges: from migrating workflows to the cloud to \noptimising existing workstreams; from establishing a hygienic data set to replacing legacy \nsystems; from deciding where to invest, partner or develop in-house, to building direct \nrelationships with viewers. None of this is easy, and most are outside broadcasters\u2019 \ntraditional skillsets.\n\nWe spoke to a number of senior executives in the European TV industry to explore these \nhigh-level issues, and the impact of innovative technologies such as artificial intelligence \n(AI). We define AI as machines performing cognitive functions through computing large \nvolumes of data to reason to sophisticated conclusions (see Exhibit 3). With 80% of media \nexecutives believing AI is the next industrial revolution, understanding its impact on the \nfuture of broadcasting will be critical to its long-term success4.\n\n\u2022 Pre-production\n\u2022 Production\n\u2022 Post-production\n\n\u2022 Media ingest and \nquality control\n\n\u2022 Transcoding\n\u2022 Access services, \n\ngraphics and DRM\n\u2022 Media storage\n\u2022 Metadata services\n\u2022 VOD packaging\n\u2022 Social media \n\npackaging\n\u2022 Distribution \n\n(traditional and \nOTT/IP)\n\n\n\nwhitepaper | Solving European broadcasters\u2019 pain points 4\n\nExhibit 3: Understanding Artificial Intelligence (AI), Machine Learning (ML)  \nand Deep Learning (DL)\n\nExhibit 4: Defining metadata\n\nARTIFICAL INTELLIGENCE\n\nMETADATA\n\nDEEP LEARNING MACHINE LEARNING\n\nSource: MTM analysis\n\n\u201cWe are at the tipping point where we are seeing [AI / ML solutions] \nmove from hype to actually driving real value\"\n- Trade body\n\nArtifical Intelligence (AI) is typicaly defined as the ability \nof a machine to perform cognitive functions we associate \n\nwith human minds such as perceiving, reasoning, learning, \ninteracting with the environment, problem solving, using \n\ndata to reason to sophisticated conclusions\n\nAt its simplest, metadata is data about data. It is a broad term used to describe individual pieces of \ninformation about specific digital files; including image, video, design, and text files. Once aggregated, this \nmetadata becomes invaluable for tagging, storage, distribution, and analysis.\nAI can be employed through automatic tagging, e.g. identifying objects or certain scenes, as well as through \nprocessing and analysis \u2013 using algorithms trained on metadata to surface results and find patterns and \nsequences.\n\nDeep Learning (DL) is most closely \nassociated to the functions of the \nbrain through deep neural networks \nthat can compute vast data sets in a \nhierarchical manner\n\nMachine Learning (ML) is the \nprocess of self-learning, where \nan AI system is asked a desired \noutcome and can iterate until a \n\nsolution is provided\n\n\n\nwhitepaper | Solving European broadcasters\u2019 pain points 5\n\nExhibit 5: Most expensive TV shows per hour of content ($m, adjusted for inflation)6\n\n* = Estimated = OTT service = Broadcaster\n\nSource: The Guardian\n\nCONTENT CREATION IS TOUGH IN A MULTI-\nPLATFORM, ULTRA-HIGH DEFINITION WORLD\n\nCreating great content is central to broadcasting. It is what drives user acquisition and \nretention. However, more hours of TV content are being produced on a greater scale \nthan ever before. And the battle between Netflix, Amazon, pay-TV companies and US \nentertainment giants is intensifying. Amazon\u2019s investment in The Lord the Rings television \nseries, for example, has an estimated cost of almost $1bn, including rights and production \ncosts, with a cost-per-hour of almost $20m (see Exhibit 5)5. For European broadcasters, \nwho are typically active only in their home market, competing with such budgets is not \nfeasible. Yet viewers\u2019 expectations around quality continue to rise.\n\n\u201cThe expectations for high value content continue to go up, in terms of \ntechnical delivery, in terms of quality, in terms of production values\u2026 \nVery few broadcasters in very few countries can create top quality \ncontent on their own\u201d\n- Trade body\n\nLord of the Rings*\n\nThe Get Down\n\nGame of Thrones\n\nThe Crown\n\nER\n\nBand of Brothers\n\nFriends\n\nRome\n\nSense8\n\nMarco Polo\n\n$20\n\n$16\n\n$15\n\n$13\n\n$13\n\n$13\n\n$10\n\n$9\n\n$10\n\n$9\n\n\n\nwhitepaper | Solving European broadcasters\u2019 pain points 6\n\nExhibit 6: Employing AI to create smart tennis highlights7\n\nOn court statistilon determines \nimportant points e.g. break points\n\nOn court statistion records length  \nof rally and speed of ball\n\nCameras automaticaly follow  \naction\n\nRecords roar of crowds to determine \npivatal points\n\nTracks unique or erratic player \nmovement\n\nSource: IBM, Soloshot, MTM analysis\n\nThis price inflation places pressure on broadcasters. Funding increases apply to production \nas well as talent. There are new demands and complexities around producing compelling \ncontent, from filming on high-resolution equipment - including ultra HD and 8K - in remote \nlocations, updating legacy systems to process high quality imaging, and transferring \nvideo content via cloud technology. This becomes especially challenging when content is \nproduced and delivered live, as is the case with premium sports.\n\nParticipants cited post-production as particularly challenging. Once content has been \nfilmed, ensuring the right content is transferred to the correct place for editing is difficult, \nrelying on sophisticated cloud technology, particularly for global content producers filming \nin multiple locations. In addition, editing together live highlights of sports competitions \nparticularly labour-intensive, taking hundreds of hours of time.\n\nRecent developments in AI have tackled these problems by applying advanced solutions \nto unstructured data sets or creating advanced robotics to solve production challenges. \nThrough employing technologies in this way, broadcasters and content producers can \ncreate new efficiencies in the production process.\n\nOne example below (Exhibit 6) looks at how applying innovative technologies to tennis can \ncreate highlights packages without the need for editors to spend hours sifting through in-\ngame footage. Each step, from filming through automatic tracking cameras to an on-court \nstatistician that records important points, can be processed using advanced technologies \nand AI.\n\n\u201cIf we produce Top Model or a sports event, there are so many \nperspectives. If it is live it is even more of an effort: everything must \nwork. And with Ultra HD we have even more cameras: we did The Voice \nin Ultra HD with not 4 but 8 cameras\u201d\n- Broadcaster\n\n\n\nwhitepaper | Solving European broadcasters\u2019 pain points 7\n\nCONTENT MANAGEMENT IS KEY TO \nSUCCESSFULLY DELIVERING ACROSS  \nMULTIPLE DEVICES\nContent management - the process of transferring, re-versioning, localising, transcoding, \nand sharing content \u2013 is becoming ever-more complex for broadcasters. With multiple \norganisations responsible for different segments in the value chain, ensuring consistency \nin content management and versioning is increasingly a challenge.\n\nDeveloping a deep understanding of content through automated metadata tagging (see \nExhibit 4) is front of mind for media executives. Rich metadata about the content they \ncreate, or distribute, provides executives with the opportunity to extract maximum value \nfrom prized content assets.\n\nAn area where rich metadata can drive real engagement and value is in deepening \nknowledge of archives, unlocking the potential value of content libraries. Broadcasters \u2013 \nand viewers - can quickly search for previous programmes with a specific actor or scenes \nfilmed in a similar location, for example. Yet executives believe that the potential of this is a \nlong way from being realised.\n\nHowever, collecting and recording accurate metadata remains a core pain point for \nbroadcasters.\n\n\u201cThe first challenge is a well-defined content management system. \nWe have huge projects running that many parts of the company \nmust access. They need different pieces of information and different \ncontent sources. It is so complex on the technological side it is a real \nchallenge to have a content management system that is future proof \nfor streaming\u201d\n- Broadcaster\n\n\u201cIf you can understand more about the content itself, both breadth \nand depth of content, early on in the process, then map that to a \ngreater understanding of the consumer, you can create really effective \nopportunities to engage through, for example, off-platform acquisition, \ncontent recommendation and targeted advertising\u201d\n- Broadcaster\n\n\u201cMetadata is always a challenge and therefore understanding \ncontent is a challenge\u2026 but you need it to provide a consistent and \ncomprehensive view\u201d\n- Pay-TV provider\n\n\u201cIntegrating metadata with our library seems like a very long way \naway\u201d\n- Trade body\n\n\n\nwhitepaper | Solving European broadcasters\u2019 pain points 8\n\nExhibit 7: How Netflix recommendations work8\n\nNETFLIX RECOMMENDATIONS\nNetflix identified over 2,000 taste groups of viewers, driving recommendations that results in over 80%  \nof all viewing. Netflix\u2019s VP Product Innovation explains the theory:\n\n\u201cThe three legs of this stool would be Netflix members; taggers who \nunderstand everything about the content; and machine learning \nalgorithms that take all the data and put things together\u201d\n\u2013 Todd Yellin, VP Product Innovation, Netflix\n\nAUDIENCE ENGAGEMENT: TECHNOLOGY CAN \nHELP TO RETAIN VIEWERS AND SUBSCRIBERS\n\nIn an increasingly fragmented media landscape, ensuring content drives engagement and \nretains viewers is a priority for broadcasters in Europe as elsewhere. Developing a deeper \nunderstanding of both content and viewers\u2019 preferences requires sophisticated metadata, \nas outlined above. When combined with algorithmic decisioning \u2013 recommendations based \non behavioural data, how a viewer acted, and preferential data, what a viewer likes \u2013 this \nresults in more accurate personalisation:\n\nThese benefits are passed onto the consumer. Combining detailed metadata on the \ncontent with well-trained ML algorithms has the potential to create a customised user \nexperience that can drive real value. Personalised recommendations based on deep \nknowledge of both the content and the viewer\u2019s preferences are a holy grail for TV \nexecutives \u2013 providing the opportunity to search by actor, director, piece of music or even \na specific scene. But accessing these layers of granularity with metadata is a real challenge \nfor broadcasters.\n\n\u201cThere are a number of things we think about in the long term: a core \narea is personalisation and recommendation. Understanding what \nis in content at a granular level to do detailed recommendations and \ncustomisation experiences is crucial for us\u201d\n- Pay-TV provider\n\n\u201cThere are too many false positives, too much volume of tags; more \nwork needs to be done in the training and accuracy of models. Making \nsure we understand the granularity is crucial in terms of taxonomy. \nThere are several tools on the way to getting there, but we don't think \nthere is anyone who is going to be there in the immediate short term\u201d\n- Pay-TV provider\n\nTo match the highly sophisticated targeting employed by the tech giants (see Exhibit 7), \nbroadcasters must deploy AI and ML for recommendation purposes, particularly to large \ncontent libraries. The key to delivering this is to collect richer and more complex data sets, \nand to develop the tools and capabilities to provide a granular understanding of the data.\n\n\n\nwhitepaper | Solving European broadcasters\u2019 pain points 9\n\nExhibit 8: Content recommendation flow\n\nConsumption Algorithmic\ndecisioning\n\nContent\ntagging\n\nBehavioural\nWatches content, adds to \nfavourited programmers, etc.\nPreferential\nLikes content, shares content\n\nUser buckets\nGroups users into defined \nbuckets before recommending\nIndividual recommendation\nRecommends content to users \non a case-by-case basis\n\nCONTENT  \nRECOMMENDATION\n\nSource: MTM analysis\n\n\u201cArtificial intelligence is very relevant\u2026 particularly for recommenda-\ntion engines suggesting similar content\u201d\n- Broadcaster\n\nCONTENT MONETISATION REQUIRES ACCURATE \nDATA ABOUT THE CONTENT AND  \nITS CONSUMPTION\nAs referenced, metadata can also be employed effectively for the monetisation of content. \nMedia executives are increasingly interested in advanced advertising; combining ad \ninventory, demographic data, addressability, and automated buying. With advertisers \nincreasingly buying advertising digitally, there are opportunities for AI supported systems \nto process vast volumes of data, track impressions, and provide real value for advertisers \nand agencies through sophisticated demographic targeting. One executive noted how the \nOTT services currently being rolled out by broadcasters can advance this model:\n\n\u201cThe ability to form new direct-to-consumer relationships is incredibly \nexciting. Starting up a VOD service is much less expensive than starting \na broadcast channel, and advanced advertising is going to be a huge \npart of that. Both linear and in OTT delivery\u201d\n- Trade body\n\n\n\nwhitepaper | Solving European broadcasters\u2019 pain points 10\n\nThe context in which an ad is delivered is another critical area for broadcasters. \nUnderstanding who the customer is, where they are and what they are watching, in order \nto serve them the correct ad at the right time, is imperative for broadcasters.  It is an \narea where advanced advertising and AI supported technology solutions can make a real \nimpact.\n\nAnother area highlighted by executives was brand safety: ensuring ads appear in an \nenvironment complementary to a brand\u2019s identity and not harmful or offensive in any \nway. Programmatic advertising, the automated process of buying ad inventory, has \ngrown significantly but concerns remain around hygiene. Advertisers want assurances \nthat ads will appear in the right context, in order to trust the buying process. Advanced \ntechnologies can provide solutions.\n\nViewability - how much of an ad is viewed \u2013 also presents challenges for advertiser and \npublishers.  Providing evidence that an ad has been fully viewed remains a critical but \ncontentious area for advertisers. Developments in facial recognition might hold some \nanswers through determining a viewer\u2019s engagement with an ad, and how they reacted.\n\n\u201cBrand communication messages resonate better in the right content \nenvironment. Content and context are both crucial for buying spots. \nThe right communication message at the right time to the right people\u201d\n- Agency\n\n\u201cHaving AI or deep learning looking intelligently at content enables us \nto move into brand safety and fraud detection, creating safe market \nplaces to appear\u201d\n- Agency\n\n\u201cFacial recognition tells us if consumers are showing positive or \nnegative emotions to branded material. That enables us to do \nsegmentation. We begin to get into areas of predictive recognition, \nunderstanding signals through neurology, which starts to give us an \nidea of how advertising actually works\u201d\n- Agency\n\nThere are multiple opportunities now for publishers and brands to refine and optimise \nthe advertising process. AI, if harnessed correctly, can help deliver tangible benefits for \nviewers, broadcasters and advertisers alike.\n\n\u201cAnything you can do that makes it easier for the brand to connect with \na consumer is valuable\u2026 you have to optimise the processes\u201d\n- Pay-TV provider\n\n\n\nwhitepaper | Solving European broadcasters\u2019 pain points 11\n\nNEXT STEPS: TO COMPETE WITH DIGITAL \nGIANTS, BROADCASTERS NEED TECHNOLOGY \nPARTNERS\nThe growing complexity of the video value chain places new demands on broadcasters, \nwho are typically managing both legacy distribution technology and new IP-based \nplatforms.  To respond to both the challenges and opportunities, executives are \nincreasingly relying on partnering with technology vendors. Building flexible and agile \nsolutions in-house is considered expensive and challenging.\n\n\u201cIf anyone says I want to build this myself, we should shoot them! \nUsing smart vendors is key\u201d\n- Pay-TV provider\n\n\u201cBroadcasters are Neolithic in their understanding of this stuff. They \ndon\u2019t have the expertise even to seek out the right companies\u201d\n- Pay-TV provider\n\nFor broadcasters, finding talented data scientists, developers, and engineers to develop \nin-house solutions is also difficult, particularly when competing with deep-pocked tech \ngiants.\n\nSome executives were candid about the challenge faced by broadcasters whose heritage is \nin traditional TV distribution rather than software development or data.\n\n\u201cIt is hard to get the engineers. The Microsofts and the Googles of this \nworld have the big layers of expertise on this. There are some great \nstart-ups working on niche problems that do really well, but this whole \nthing is a big change for broadcasters\u201d\n- Trade body\n\nAggregation - where suppliers can draw together solutions from across the ecosystem \n- is a developing area highlighted by media executives. As AI and ML solutions are \ncontinuously iterating, staying abreast of developments is increasingly difficult. Developing \nrelationships with trustworthy partners can help broadcasters navigate the complex and \nevolving landscape and identify opportunities for innovation.\n\n\u201cWho is the best at machine learning algorithms at any one time? Being \nable to compare and contrast would be useful\u2026\u201d\n- Pay-TV provider\n\nFinding the right technology partners is crucial for broadcasters.

What is a container and where does it fit into cloud security? \n\n\u201cContainers\u201d and \u201cmicroservices\u201d are an approach to developing applications for a cloud \nenvironment. The word \u201ccontainer\u201d most likely brings to mind a shipping container, or box. \nAs the word applies to the cloud, it\u2019s not far off. A container is an easily moveable \u201cbox\u201d of \nservices that supports the applications that run within it, while providing a connection to the \ncloud host environment. Microservices are the applications that run inside the containers.\n\nWhy Containers?\nThe concept of containers is somewhat similar to the idea of a virtual machine itself. But \ncontainers are much more lightweight than virtual machines; more flexible, scalable, and \neasier to use. They can pack more applications into a given physical infrastructure than \nvirtual machines, and without relying on a guest operating system or replicate. Container \ntechnologies can also be spun up instantly, and don\u2019t virtualize entire servers, but rather the \napplications themselves. \n\n2whitepaper | Cloud Security and the Containers Approach\n\n\n\nThe Benefits of Using Containers\nFor many years, software developers were building full programs that were installed on a \ncomputer and ran on a specific OS. But since all of the functions within the program weren\u2019t \nindependent, a failure in any part of the program could crash the entire system. Booting up \na new virtual machine with the service could take a few minutes, or even a few hours, for \nparticularly large services.\n\nContainers and microservices are an improvement on this old system, and provide a better \nway of building software for cloud deployment. Containers \u201cspin up\u201d in less than a second, so \nfailure recovery is nearly instantaneous. Contrary to writing a giant, monolithic program of all \nuser functions, developers are building microservices that each perform a very specific task. \nMaking the functions fully independent from one another also allows the development team \nto use the best programming language for each function, rather than choosing one language \nfor all functions.\n\nContainers were conceived as the answer to a matrix of restriction  \nand incompatibilities.\n\n \nBy providing a common interface to migrate applications between environments, you don\u2019t \nneed to rebuild the application to ensure compatibility in the new environment. Various \nmicroservices come together to form a complete cloud-based service for the user.\n\n3whitepaper | Cloud Security and the Containers Approach\n\n\n\nContainers and Digital Transformation\nContainers and microservices help the most innovative software companies to increase the \nefficiency of their businesses, build more reliable software, improve a continuous delivery \nprocess, and transform their application development processes and IT infrastructure. \nAs companies embrace new technologies like these, security must be more than an \nafterthought. In the era of digital transformation, the focus needs to be shifted from securing \nnetwork perimeters to securing data spread across all systems, devices, and the cloud.\n\nThe world\u2019s largest technology companies, including Microsoft and Google, are now  \nusing cloud containers \u2014 and they\u2019re increasing their presence in production environments \nevery day.\n\nAccording to a Red Hat survey, 67 percent of organizations are planning to start using \ncontainers in production environments over the next two years. According to another survey \nby Cluster HQ, a container data management company, 73 percent of enterprises are \ncurrently using containers for development and testing.\n\nContainers vs VMs\nOne of the most common misconceptions about containers is that they act as light virtual \nmachines (VMs). Containers create an isolation boundary at the application level rather than \nat the server level. This isolation means that if anything goes wrong in that single container \nit only affects that individual container and not the whole VM or whole server. That leads \nmany people to think they are perfectly isolated \u2014 but they\u2019re not. A malicious container \ncan influence the execution of other containers through the common kernel, by exploiting a \nkernel vulnerability or leveraging the privileges of the compromised container.\n\n4whitepaper | Cloud Security and the Containers Approach\n\nGuest OS Guest OS Guest OS\n\nBins/Libs Bins/Libs Bins/Libs\n\nApp 1 App 2 App 3\n\nHypervisor\n\nHost Operating System\n\nInfrastructure\n\nVirtual Machines\n\nBins/Libs Bins/Libs Bins/Libs\n\nApp 1 App 2 App 3\n\nDocker Engine\n\nOperating System\n\nContainers\n\nInfrastructure\n\nhttp://Microsoft\nhttp://Google\nhttps://www.csoonline.com/article/2984543/vulnerabilities/as-containers-take-off-so-do-security-concerns.html\nhttps://www.cio.com/article/2984545/data-center/as-containers-take-off-so-do-security-concerns.html#tk.rss_all\n\n\nBecause containers roll an application together \u2014 with its dependencies and interfaces \n\u2014 into a single re-deployable unit, a container can be run on any host system with \nthe appropriate kernel components while shielding the application from behavioral \ninconsistencies due to variances in software installed on the host. Multiple containers \ncan be run on a single host OS without the use of a hypervisor, while still being isolated \nfrom neighboring containers. This layer of isolation introduces consistency, flexibility, and \nportability that enables rapid software deployment and testing.\n\nRecognizable Container Software\nOne of the best examples of recognizable container software is Docker. At its core, Docker \nis an open-source project that uses several resource isolation features of the Linux kernel \nto sandbox an application, its dependencies, and interfaces inside of an atomic unit. \u201cYour \napplication is really more secure when it\u2019s running inside a Docker container,\u201d said Nathan \nMcCauley, director of security at Docker, which currently dominates the container market.\n\nIt does not require any configuration off the bat \u2014 just one simple command to install it \nand you are in. But Docker is not a security tool meant to be used out of the box. Its default \nconfiguration provides a lot of settings that allow it to become much more secure and \nreliable. While it may not be for beginners, Docker is a great tool for developers.\n\nAlthough containers aren\u2019t as isolated from one another as virtual machines, they are more \nsecure than applications that run by themselves. And because containers are an easy way to \npackage and distribute applications, many are doing just that.\n\nBut not all containers software available on the web can be trusted, and not all libraries and \ncomponents included in those containers are secure, patched, and up-to-date.\n\n5whitepaper | Cloud Security and the Containers Approach\n\nApp 1 App 2 App 3\n\nGuest OS Guest OS Guest OS\n\nHypervisor\n\nInfrastructure\n\nVirtualization Approach\n\nApp 1 App 2 App 3\n\nDocker Engine\n\nOperating System\n\nDocker Container Approach\n\nInfrastructure\n\n\n\nContainer Security\nSince cloud containers became popular, one of the biggest concerns has become how to \nkeep them secure. The best practices for securing container environments are not only \nabout hardening containers or the servers they run on after security has been breached \u2014 \nthey focus on securing the entire environment right off the bat. Security must be considered \nfrom the moment container images are pulled from a registry up until the containers are \nspun down from a runtime or production environment.\n\nSecDevOps: Starting Security at the Beginning\nThe best way to make your cloud containers secure is to keep security in mind from  \nstep one.\n\nAt SoftServe, we use a specific security lifecycle:\nSecurity + DevOps = SecDevOps. In other words, DevOps moves security closer to the \nbeginning of the software lifecycle, making it an integral part of the secure development \nlifecycle (SDLC).\n\nMore and more businesses realize that initiating security at QA time, or as a reaction to a \nsecurity threat, is too late. Putting security earlier in the development lifecycle process causes \na much higher rate of success and much higher throughput.\n\nSecDevOps seeks to embed security inside the development process as deeply as DevOps \nhas done with operations. Classic DevOps is designed to automate software development, \naccelerating the process to satisfy the needs of operations to acquire code that immediately \nworks in production. SecDevOps, in contrast, automates the secure coding component of \ndevelopment to satisfy the needs of the security team, establishing and maintaining software \nthat is immediately secure in production.\n\n6whitepaper | Cloud Security and the Containers Approach\n\nSecurity in the SDLC\n\nSecure\nRequirements\n\nReview\n\nSecure\nDesign\nReview\n\nSecure\nCode\n\nReview\n\nPenetration\nTesting\n\nRequirements\nDefinition Design Develop Test Deploy/\n\nImplement\n\nMaintain\n\n\n\nIn most cases, the correct model for container security is a collaborative one with well-\ndefined responsibilities that SecDevOps experts provide. Keep in mind, however: DevOps \nteams are not security experts and security teams are not usually as well-versed in DevOps. \nSecurity teams want to ensure that software is delivered without vulnerabilities, no matter \nhow long it takes, and DevOps aims to deliver the best quality software as fast as possible. \nThat being said, the future of this collaboration lies in the ability of security and development \nteams to communicate with empathy.\n\nPutting security in the process from the beginning provides the opportunity to secure \narchitecture, infrastructure, environment, and application from scratch, instead of looking at \nthe entire application and trying to understand its potential risks. This approach allows for \nthe discovery and correction of issues before going into production, and provides the ability \nto automate security processes into the development cycle that reduce human mistakes and \nimprove risk management.\n\nWith large and complex applications, it\u2019s necessary to ensure the security of the whole entity, \nrather than its bits and pieces. With the challenge of securing microservices, it\u2019s necessary \nto protect a large number of services and their implementations one by one. They interact \nwith each other through various APIs and data flows. More services means more elements \nexposed to cyber-attacks or leakage, so a larger span of security means better protection to \ncover all of them, rather than each at a time.\n\nBest Practices for Secure Containers\nReducing the attack surface is a basic goal of security. Containerization has specific structural \nand operational elements that require scrutiny. Specifically, the underlying shared kernel \narchitecture of containers requires special attention beyond securing the host; it requires \nmaintaining standard configurations and container profiles. Here are some best practices for \nkeeping your containers secure.\n\n7whitepaper | Cloud Security and the Containers Approach\n\n\n\nKeep It Simple\nThe first step is pretty straightforward: Keep it simple. Try to keep your container ecosystem \nas simple as possible. You should run processes in separate containers, even if these are \nservices that depend on one another. You should also use the container-linking feature  \nto connect two containers rather than combining them in the same one. You should also \nfocus on keeping the footprint of containers small \u2014 don\u2019t load unnecessary packages or \nservices that just waste resources \u2014 and make sure that your containers are designed to  \nbe easily replaceable.\n\nComprehensive Vulnerability Management\nGoing back to major areas for reviewing container security risks, we need to mention the \nimportance of having a comprehensive vulnerability management program. Vulnerability \nmanagement goes far beyond scanning images when they are first downloaded from a \nregistry. Containers can easily pass through the development cycle with access controls or \nother policies that are too loose, resulting in corruption that causes the application to break \ndown or a compromised runtime.\n\nProactive Checks\nImplementing proactive checks throughout the lifecycle is another measure that ensures \nsecure containers. Part of managing security through the container lifecycle helps to ensure \nthe integrity of the container images in the registry and to enforce controls as they have \nbeen deployed into production. Image signing or fingerprinting could also be used, allowing \nyou to verify the integrity of the containers. Ensure that only approved images are running in \nyour environment.\n\nLeast Privileges in Runtime\nTry to have the least privileges in runtime. This is a basic security best practice that applies \nequally in the world of containers. When a vulnerability is exploited, it generally provides the \nattacker with access and privileges that are equal to those of the application or process that \nhas been compromised. Ensuring that containers operate with the least privileges and access \nrequired to get the job done reduces your exposure to risk.\n\nEnforce Network Segmentation\nOn running containers, make sure to enforce network segmentation or micro-segmentation \nto segregate clusters or zones of containers by application or workload. In addition to being \na highly effective best practice, network segmentation is a must-have for container-based \napplications that are subject to PCI DSS.\n\nMonitor, Monitor, Monitor\nAnd as we already know, monitoring is a key. Do an active monitor of container activity and \nuser access as is it realized in any typical IT environment to quickly identify any suspicious or \nmalicious activity. Log all administrative user access to containers for auditing.\n\n8whitepaper | Cloud Security and the Containers Approach\n\n\n\nThings to Watch Out For\nProactive security is preferable to reactive security in any situation, but sometimes it pays to \nkeep an eye on particular problem areas.\n\nHere are few major areas to consider when reviewing container security:\n\nKernel-Level Threats\nIn containers, the kernel is shared among all containers and the host, making the kernel \nmore vulnerable. Kernel exploits range from privilege escalation, to arbitrary code execution, \nand even Denial of Service. Ensure the host operating system is hardened, up-to-date, and \nthat it leverages kernel security patching features.\n\nBypassing Isolation\nAttackers who gain access to one container can gain access to other containers or even \nto the host itself. If the hacker can get root privileges inside a containerized app, he can \npotentially gain root access to the host. This can impact potential privilege escalation attacks \nwhere the user gains higher privileges, such as those for the root user, and can be done \nthrough a bug in application code. This is the primary concern surrounding containers and \nbut can be avoided by employing a comprehensive approach based on system hardening, \nstrengthening default configurations, and patching.\n\nInsecure Images\nIf container images aren\u2019t downloaded from trusted sources, there is a high risk of \ndownloading malicious images into your environment. Those images could contain  \nmalware and backdoors, or even outdated software with known vulnerabilities. If an  \nattacker can trick and convince you to run his image, both the host and your data are  \nin danger. In an open-source environment, images created by any organization\u2019s  \n\n9whitepaper | Cloud Security and the Containers Approach\n\n\n\ndevelopers are often updated and accessible. This can create an endless stream of \nuncontrolled code that may harbor vulnerabilities or unexpected behaviors. To prevent  \nthis, always download images from trusted sources and ensure that images do not  \ncontain any software with known vulnerabilities.\n\nCompromising Secrets\nWhen a container accesses any service, it will likely require a secret, like an API key or \nusername and password. An attacker who can get access to this secret will also have access \nto the service. This problem becomes more acute in a microservice architecture in which \ncontainers are constantly stopping and starting. The best practices to keep your secrets safe \ninclude: encrypting secrets while in transit; encrypting secrets at rest; preventing secrets \nfrom unintentionally leaking when consumed by the final application; and strictly adhere \nto the principle of least-privilege, where an application only has access to the secrets that it \nneeds \u2014 no more, no less.\n\nDenial-of-Service (DoS) Attacks\nA container could behave in a way that effectively creates a DoS attack on other containers. \nFor example, opening sockets repeatedly will quickly bring the entire host machine to a crawl \nand eventually cause it to freeze up. DoS attacks may include scenarios where one container \nseizes control of all available system resources to stop other containers from operating \nproperly. If a single container can monopolize access to certain resources \u2013 including \nmemory and more secret resources such as user IDs \u2013 it can starve out other containers on \nthe host, resulting in a denial of service, whereby legitimate users are unable to access part \nor all of the system. To avoid this issue in most cases, try limiting the amount of resources, \nCPU, and memory allocated to the container. The implementation of monitoring tools can \nalso help to track and deal with DoS attacks.\n\nCross-Container Threats\nCross-container threats usually arise due to weak network defaults such as a bridge \nconfiguration. An application on one container may be able to compromise another \ncontainer on the same host or on the same local network (for example gaining unauthorized \naccess to the database container on the same host). To prevent cross-container threats, use \nproper networking management with custom configuration and user-defined networks.\n\nDefault Configurations\nSystems that use default configurations have a high potential for information security \nbreaches, because cyber-criminals tend to look for common standard configuration. Make \nsure to customize your containers, not only to better suit your own needs but also to \ndecrease the likelihood of compromised security. Do the additional work to harden your \ncontainer-based environment and make it more secure and robust.\n\n10whitepaper | Cloud Security and the Containers Approach\n\n\n\nConclusion\nContainerized applications can be inherently more secure than their predecessors with the \nright attention to security. Microservices provide a high level of risk mitigation due to the fact \nthat they are container-based, feature the ability to easily rollback if needed, and provide \ngreater system resilience.\n\nOrganizations can improve their security with the use of containers, without adding \nincremental overhead to their application infrastructure. Containers provide isolation for \napplications from their host and from each other. They minimize the use of resources from \nthe underlying infrastructure, and reduce the surface area of the host itself when configured \nproperly. While applications secured in containers are already more secure, there are \nendless ways to make your containers even safer.\n\nAdditional Resources\nDocker Secure Deployment Guidelines\nAWS: Docker on AWS\nDocker Docs: Docker Security\nRedhat: Container Security Guide\n\n11whitepaper | Cloud Security and the Containers Approach\n\nhttps://github.com/GDSSecurity/Docker-Secure-Deployment-Guidelines\nhttps://d0.awsstatic.com/whitepapers/docker-on-aws.pdf\nhttps://docs.docker.com/engine/security/security/\nhttps://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_enterprise_linux_atomic_host/7/html/container_security_guide/overview\n\n\nABOUT US\nSoftServe is a global digital authority and consulting company, operating \nat the cutting edge of technology.

Some other trends, \nnamely Sensors, Devices Mesh, Cognitive Computing, and Virtual Reality, \nstill have a long way to go, but have already been seasoned in 2015.\n\nTo synchronize with business continuity and opportunities uncovered by \nthe beginning of 2016, here are the four primary focus areas to work on in \nterms of the Internet of Things (IoT), Artificial Intelligence (AI), and Virtual \nReality (VR):\n\n \ufffd Sensor Network (IoT)\n\n \ufffd Devices Mesh (IoT)\n\n \ufffd Cognitive Computing\n\n \ufffd Virtual Reality\n\nThere are two more areas which heat up the tech market, but require \nspecial attention: Autonomous Robots and Additive Manufacturing. \n\nSensor Network and Device Mesh \n\nThe Internet of Things (IoT) is a technological trend that won\u2019t lose its buzz \nin the market for at least five more years. It is a new paradigm shift from \nhuman-to-machine communication to machine-to-machine communication, \nwhere devices are getting smaller, autonomous, and able to communicate \nwith each other without human involvement. The primary goal and the main \nmotivation for IoT research is Device Mesh Networks. Devices connectivity \nand communication is a basic platform for every IoT use case:\n\n \ufffd Sensor networks (gathering data from \nareas that are hard to reach)\n\n \ufffd Assembling pipelines (car \nmanufacturing pipelines)  \n\n \ufffd Smart house (smart lighting, smart \nlocking)\n\n \ufffd Smart city (traffic flow control, \nwaste management, water \nquality, smart lighting)\n\n \ufffd Automotive (vehicle-to-vehicle \ncommunication, road safety) \n\nhttps://youtu.be/kPclKYSd8dw\nhttp://united.softserveinc.com/blogs/prototyping-biosensors-arduino/\nhttp://arstechnica.com/the-multiverse/2015/06/realdoll-is-working-on-ai-and-robotic-heads-for-its-next-gen-sex-dolls-2/\nhttp://united.softserveinc.com/blog/decentralization-internet-of-things/\n\n\nebook\n\nWHAT\u2019S NEXT FOR THE INTERNET OF THINGS? 4\n\n2016 will drive Internet of Things initiatives with a focus on Mesh \nNetworking, along with technologies for these areas:\n\n1. Sensors networks based on mesh technology\n\n2. Fog Computing with edge connected devices\n\n3. Car accident avoidance\n\nCognitive Computing \n\nCognitive Computing refers to the simulation of human thinking processes \nin a computerized model, which involves self-learning systems using \ndata mining, pattern recognition, and both supervised and unsupervised \nmachine learning to mimic the way the human brain works. The research \nis stimulated by Cognitive Computing as a groundwork of technologies \nsuch as Affective Computing, Robotics, Data Science, etc. Typical \napplication cases for cognitive computing include the following:\n\n1. Business Intelligence - improving user experience, creating interactive \nreports with deeper competitive insight, meaningful dashboards, and \nscorecards.\n\n2. Computer Vision and Object Recognition - acquiring, processing, and \nanalyzing images and high-dimensional data from the real world.\n\n3. Speech Recognition - identifying words and phrases from audio \nsignals.\n\n4. Natural Language Processing - processing and analyzing textual \ninformation to derive meaning from human or natural language input.\n\n5. Predictive Analytics - exploiting patterns found in historical and \ntransactional data to identify risks and opportunities in order to make \nplausible predictions of the future.\n\n\n\nebook\n\nWHAT\u2019S NEXT FOR THE INTERNET OF THINGS? 5\n\n6. Recommender Systems - information-filtering technology that enables \nselection of the items of interest to the user, based on comparing their \nown profile with the whole community of users.\n\n7. Decision Analysis - identifying, clearly representing, and formally \nassessing important aspects of a decision, for prescribing a \nrecommended course of action in various business areas.\n\n8. Data Segmentation and Cluster Analysis - techniques for data \npartitioning so that it can be used more efficiently within marketing and \nother business domains.\n\n9. Social Network Analysis - discovering social structures through the \nuse of network and graph theories.\n\n10. Fraud Detection - identifying suspicious patterns which indicate \nfraud or security threats and minimizing risks and preventing damage \nthrough enabling real-time reaction.\n\n11. Anomaly Detection - identifying items, events or observations which \ndo not conform to an expected pattern in data.\n\nTechnologies involved:\n\n \ufffd Voice/Speech recognition\n\n \ufffd Facial expression recognition\n\n \ufffd Gesture recognition\n\n \ufffd EEG, ECG, EDA, reography\n\n \ufffd Sensors fusion\n\n \ufffd Digital signal and image \nprocessing\n\n \ufffd Context recognition\n\n \ufffd Deep learning\n\n \ufffd Data visualization\n\n\n\nebook\n\nWHAT\u2019S NEXT FOR THE INTERNET OF THINGS? 6\n\nVirtual Reality\n\nVirtual Reality (VR) is an artificial environment created with software \nand presented to a user in such a way that belief is suspended and VR is \naccepted as a real environment. On a computer, Virtual Reality is primarily \nexperienced through two of the five senses: sight and sound.\n\nThere was a slow trickle of AR/VR investments from 2006 until late 2014. \nThen Magic Leap raised $542 million from Google and other tech giants \nbecoming a starting gun for investment acceleration, with nearly $1 billion \nbeing poured into the sector in 2015, according to Digi Capital. \n\nWith Samsung Gear VR, Oculus, PlayStation VR and others set to hit the \nmarket, 2016 is going to be a big year for virtual reality. The industry is \nexpected to see a big windfall over the next few years, and a report from \nTrendForce estimates that the virtual reality market could grow to US$70 \nbillion in 2020. \n\nBesides VR headsets, the VR applications and games market is growing, as \nis VR content, and consumer 3D cameras are approaching the market. The \narea where VR can be used is very wide: Military, Education, Healthcare, \nEntertainment, Fashion, Heritage, Business, Engineering, Sport, Media, \nScientific Visualization, Telecommunications, Construction, Film, and \nProgramming Languages \u2013 even the sky is not the limit.\n\nDuring our investigation at SoftServe, we tend to work with\u00a0Unity \nIDE\u00a0and\u00a0Oculus SDK. Some of our demo projects were related to porting \nexisting games into VR or porting real CAD objects into a VR Scene.\n\nOut of a wide range of technology trends that are rocking today\u2019s market, \nthe Internet of Things seems to develop at the greatest possible speed. \n\nhttp://press.trendforce.com/node/prints/2210\nhttp://press.trendforce.com/node/prints/2210\nhttps://unity3d.com/\nhttps://unity3d.com/\nhttps://developer.oculus.com/\n\n\nThe IoT Service Offering\n\nAt SoftServe we understand that the concept of the IoT is not enough; also knowing how \n\nto design for it, targeting both humans and machines, is essential.

It \u2019s now become a known fact that \nmany banks are planning to complete IBOR \nreplacement projects by the end of 2021.\n\nOne major problem that banks often face is \nthere is not one single IBOR deadline\u2014the \ndeadline keeps changing.\n\nAs the end of 2020 approaches, banks must \nstart supporting new products. Banks are \nalso obliged to enter a new risk-free rate in \nall new contracts that are issued, latest by \nthe final quarter of 2020. Now, banks need \nto prove to banking regulators that they are \nmoving at an acceptable pace from the IBOR \nto similar international equivalent standard, \nincluding the United Kingdom\u2019s Sterling Index \nAverage Rate (SONIA). \n\nThis is just one milestone, which is the same \nfor U.S. dollars and Euros. In short, banks \nhave to stop making assumptions and work \nat the same time to avoid discrepancies. \nBanks only have a year (2021) to prove their \nreadiness to the regulators. Unfortunately, \nfor some banks, the regulators plan on seeing \na pre-cessation trigger for IBOR by the end \nof 2020.\n\nConsidering the current situation, who \ncan be ready for multiple factors? For \n\ninstance, what\u2019s the approach banks will \nadopt to deal with non-performing loans? \nIsn\u2019t dealing with this complex issue along \nwith the IBOR transitions going to put a lot \nof pressure on the bank\u2019s performance and \nresources? The banks have too much on their \nplate as of now.\n\nIf any bank fails to support non-IBOR prod-\nucts by the end of 2021, then they are likely to \nbe in trouble and face challenges. In line with \nthe following policy, it has more become a \ncompetition between banks supporting IBOR \ntransitions and those who do not as of now. \n\n\n\nWhitepaper Are Banks Ready to Move Forwards with IBOR Transitions? 3\n\nRESEARCH  \nAND ANALYTICS\n\nLooking at the deadlines, one can sug-\ngest that regulators are in a hurry, but \n\nare banks lagging behind or on the track? \nAlthough many banks have adjusted to \nworking remotely, there are still some that \nrequire a lot of work in this space. The results \nof multi-dimensional analysis are enough to \nshowcase and back this point. The main topic \nfor SoftServe's Financial Services team was \nthe \u2018IBOR transition in the COVID-19 era\u2019 and \nan expert research showed the results:\n\nBy the way, lockdown has put a major impact \non the IBOR transition programs, which were \ngoing just fine before the pandemic.\n\nWith the on-going corona crises, banks \nhave laid off many employees to cut costs. \nAlthough it may seem the right option at \nthe moment, once the crises is over, banks \nmay find it hard to find skilled individuals. \nSimilarly, with a lot of people working from \nhome, the hiring process can be slower than \nexpected. \n\nWhen the overall process of IBOR replace-\nment demands solid efforts and deep exper-\ntise, banks need more resources to make the \nprocess functional and to deliver the results \non time. Unfortunately, with a pandemic, it \ndoes not seem to be happening.\n\n52%\nOver half of 52% people confirmed the tran-\nsition program is in place, but is not going \nforward at an expected rate due to different \nreasons\n\n21%\n21% have not even started the program yet\n\n27%\nJust 27% are right on track and moving for-\nward as per schedule with the transition pro-\ngram\n\nhttps://www.softserveinc.com/en-us/industries/financial-serviceshttps://www.softserveinc.com/en-us/industries/financial-services\n\n\nWhitepaper Are Banks Ready to Move Forwards with IBOR Transitions? 4\n\nBANKS HAVE TO MAKE \nACTIONS NOW \n\nBanks face many problems and SoftServe \nhas a few solutions to help solve the prob-\n\nlem through multiple dimensions.\n\nStrategic Focus\n\nFirst of all, banks have to renew their appli-\ncation strategy to become modern organi-\nzations in line with the new reality. Ask key \nquestions, such as: \n\n\u2022 Does the bank have a proper IT strategy? \n\n\u2022 Are the existing platforms and applica-\ntions able to work with complex data \nchallenges? \n\n\u2022 Do you have platforms which are based on \nmicroservices or application architecture \nwas de-signed for the cloud? \n\nThe key point is to focus entire IT strategy for the \nfuture.\n\nFocus on Agile Practices\n\nAgile practices enable banks to deal with \nunpredictable changes and ambiguity. Hence, \nIBOR replacement is the best time to adopt/\nexpand these practices. Furthermore, agile \npractices help in engaging cross-functional \nteams for a better outcome.\n\n \nCustomers Experience  \n\nIt\u2019s the bank\u2019s duty to educate the customer \nregarding the transition and its impact on \nthem. Treating end-customers fairly in the \nwhole situation is known as conduct risk. \nBanks must ask customers basic questions: \n\n\u2022 Are you providing training to your rela-\ntionship managers or sales team, so they \ncan educate your customers? \n\n\u2022 Are you satisfied with the information you \nare providing to your customers? \n\n\u2022 Are you satisfied with the informational \nchannels of your bank?\n\nSoftware Adoption\n\nAs we said above, banks are moving around \nto fit the needs of the customers. One way \nto deal with it is by migrating to the cloud, \nbuild hybrid clouds (Anthos PoC) or change \nthe mode to a more FinTech type, like Soft-\nware-as-a-Service (SaaS) to encourage future \nadoption. The modern-day technique which \nSoftServe recommends often to banks is an \nupgrade for the whole system based on agile \npractice and assisting the customer experi-\nence during the adoption phase.\n\nPartner in place\n\nOtherwise, banks need to consider two \noptions relocate resources from existing \ninternal programs or look for IBOR partner. \nBanks have to approach two directions and \nbuild a solid partnership to the technology \nand services partners at the same time. It will \nlead to saving costs and speed-up the overall \nproject pace. \n\nhttps://demo.softserveinc.com/multi-cloud-api/\n\n\nWhitepaper Are Banks Ready to Move Forwards with IBOR Transitions? 5\n\nLIBOR  \nSUCCESSFUL CASE\n\nTo understand it better, let\u2019s take an exam-\nple: one of a bank\u2019s transition program, \n\nwhich SoftServe was leading.\n\nProject started with the Discovery phase. \nSoftServe's experts, using regulations anal-\nysis, executed independent analysis of the \npotential business threats to the bank\u2019s pro-\ncesses and corresponding technical threats \nto the upstream and downstream systems. \n\nAs the results, the Discovery phase allowed \nto: \n\n\u2022 Define business divisions and processes \nunder critical threat\n\n\u2022 Design requirements to the existing origi-\nnation and servicing systems of the bank\n\n\u2022 Execute \u201cas-is to-be\u201d gap analysis of the \nexisting and new data model of the data \nwarehouse and corresponding data flows\n\n\u2022 Implementation roadmap aligned with the \nstrategic goals of the LIBOR (London IBOR) \nprogram  \n\nValue delivered\n\n\u2022 The bank guaranteed successful continuity \nof the regulatory reporting and back-of-\nfices processes after the introduction of \nthe new reference interest rates\n\n\u2022 Running of the new, middle, and back \nbooks of all products of the bank in the \nsame data model\n\n\u2022 Capability of the multi-interest rate prod-\nucts introduction\n\n\u2022 Retention of the existing internal reporting \nflows\n\n\u2022 Interest rate type agnostic data ware-\nhouse\n\nNote: the bank did not consider such wide \ncoverage of application upgrade, but projects \ndemonstrated that it was not focused on tran-\nsition only, but also to make their system able \nto adapt to new changes.\n\nToday the scope of uncertainty for the banks \nis so wide, they need to stay updated; oth-\nerwise, the IBOR transition is bound to get \nslowed down. Although remote working \nis a problem of now, that must not affect \nthe IBOR transition at any cost. Working on \nthe above-mentioned practices, SoftServe \nenables banks to solve such complex issues. \n\n\n\nWhitepaper Are Banks Ready to Move Forwards with IBOR Transitions? 6\n\nFinancial \nInstitution \nHomework \n\nSoftServe \nResponsibility \n\nResults \n\nLegal frame \n\nArchitecture \nassesment \n\nRequirements \nanalysis\n\nInfrastructure \ndesign \n\nData strategy \ndesign \n\nFinance frame\n\nFinancial institution IBOR framework \n\nSoftServe services during the IBOR discovery phase \n\nData model \nre-engineering \n\nEngineering \nservices \n\nOperational processes \noptimization \n\nAgile Framework \nimplementation \n\nSoftServe services during the implementation phase \n\nGuaranteed \ncontinuity of the \ncritical processes \n\nSingle data model \nfor all product \n\nbooks \n\nRetention of the \ninternal reporting and \noperational processes \n\nExtended capabilities \nof the interest rate \n\nproducts \n\nDelivered business value \n\nOperational frame Regulatory frame \n\nArchitecture vision and implementation Roadmap \n\nFramework requirements \n\n\n\nWhitepaper Are Banks Ready to Move Forwards with IBOR Transitions? 7\n\nIS THIS THE END OF A \nJORNEY?\n\nBanks must be ready for the very natural \nprocess of change management, espe-\n\ncially when faced with resistance from the \nmanagement in the two most prominent \nareas: \n\n\u2022 One major area of resistance is of \nresources in terms of changing roadmap \nand priorities which will lead to new dead-\nlines, budgets.

This changed the \nconsumer world and introduced us to a whole new era of shopping.\n\nAmazon\u2019s algorithms, using a method called \u201citem-to-item collaborative \nfiltering\u201d, are able to provide targeted shopping recommendations by creating \na personalized experience for each person. Even in a very basic form, this was \nthe beginning of using machine learning in a very practical manner.\n\nBut can such artificial intelligence and machine learning also act as an \nenabler for changes in medicine and healthcare, as much as Amazon\u2019s \nalgorithm changed consumerism?\n\nhttp://fortune.com/2012/07/30/amazons-recommendation-secret/\nhttp://www.cs.umd.edu/~samir/498/Amazon-Recommendations.pdf\nhttp://www.cs.umd.edu/~samir/498/Amazon-Recommendations.pdf\n\n\nwhite paper\n\nHOW WILL ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE CHANGE HEALTHCARE? 3\n\nA Difficult Start for AI\n\nArtificial intelligence has not been popular lately. Leading thinkers have \nattacked the concept\u2014Stephen Hawking and Bill Gates have both voiced \ntheir concern. In a\u00a0BBC interview, Hawking explains that the development \nof full artificial intelligence could spell the end of the human race.\n\nSome people in medicine, however,\u00a0don\u2019t think that way. It\u2019s worth a \nlook at different alternatives and use cases of how artificial intelligence \ncould potentially bring value to the process of healthcare delivery and the \ntreatment of diseases. Which options the healthcare community would \nthen embrace is up to health leaders and patients to decide.\n\nAI and Healthcare\n\nThe strongly regulated healthcare industry has made little use of artificial \nintelligence so far. One of the problems has always been that healthcare \nis too complex. In order to predict anything around one\u2019s health, we \nneed information on demographics, proteins, multi-gene interactions, \nenvironmental effects, and a whole host of other facets,\u00a0writes Rebecca \nHarrington in Popular Science.\n\nBut that could be changing. Last month, software company IBM announced \nits plans for a deal with Merge Healthcare. For IBM, it could open up huge \npossibilities to use artificial intelligence in medicine, as the\u00a0Wall Street \nJournal reports. Those possibilities are startling and exciting:\n\nAI to Predict Drug Resistance\n\nCould AI predict healthcare outcomes? Researchers are working on \nways to use AI and machine learning to predict responses from two \nchemotherapy medications used to treat breast cancer patients. The \nunderlying problem is that not everyone with the same cancer responds in \nthe same way.\n\nhttp://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-30290540\nhttp://medcitynews.com/2015/02/4-ways-healthcare-putting-artificial-intelligence-machine-learning-use/\nhttp://united.softserveinc.com/blogs/top-healthcare-trends-2016/\nhttp://www.popsci.com/how-artificial-intelligence-can-make-drugs-better-and-faster\nhttp://www.popsci.com/how-artificial-intelligence-can-make-drugs-better-and-faster\nhttp://www.merge.com/\nhttp://www.wsj.com/articles/ibm-crafts-a-role-for-artificial-intelligence-in-medicine-1439265840\nhttp://www.wsj.com/articles/ibm-crafts-a-role-for-artificial-intelligence-in-medicine-1439265840\n\n\nwhite paper\n\nHOW WILL ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE CHANGE HEALTHCARE? 4\n\nPeter Rogan, a professor at the University of Western Ontario,\u00a0reports\u00a0that \nartificial intelligence is a powerful tool to predict drug outcomes because \nit looks at the sum of all the interacting genes. The results of Rogan\u2019s team \nhave been published\u00a0in the journal Molecular Oncology. They found it was \npossible to predict which women with breast cancer would experience \nimprovements when using the drug Paclitaxel.\n\n\u201cDid you take your pill?\u201d \u2013 How AI Could \nSupport Medication Adherence\nCan AI help to check whether we took our pills? According to\u00a0MedCity \nNews, a company in the US does exactly that.\u00a0AiCure\u00a0is a startup that uses \nartificial intelligence on patient\u2019s mobile devices to confirm medication \ningestion support in clinical trials and high-risk populations. How does it \nwork? AICure\u2019s HIPAA-compliant software captures and analyzes evidence \nof medication ingestion. A smartphone\u2019s camera is used to understand \nwhether patients took the medication correctly.\n\nReal-time data is also centralized for immediate intervention and \nlongitudinal tracking of adherence patterns.\u00a0Research\u00a0found that patient \nnon-adherence to prescribed medications is associated with poor \ntherapeutic outcomes, progression of disease, and causes billions of \n\nhttp://mediarelations.uwo.ca/2015/09/18/researchers-at-western-university-hope-to-use-artificial-intelligence-to-improve-breast-cancer-patient-outcomes/\nhttp://www.moloncol.org/article/S1574-7891%2815%2900146-5/fulltext\nhttp://medcitynews.com/2014/11/aicure-artificial-intelligence-medication-adherence/\nhttp://medcitynews.com/2014/11/aicure-artificial-intelligence-medication-adherence/\nhttps://www.aicure.com/\nhttp://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3934668/\n\n\nwhite paper\n\nHOW WILL ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE CHANGE HEALTHCARE? 5\n\ndollars per year in avoidable direct health care costs. Now, healthcare professionals \nonly need to ensure that every patient makes use of his or her smartphone.\n\nAI for Smarter Drug \nDevelopment\nIBM Watson\u00a0is probably one of the most well-known \nexamples of a supercomputer that has proven its \nabilities in AI beyond the lab. Besides answering \nquestions for the quiz show\u00a0Jeopardy, Watson is \nalso able to understand and extract key information \nby looking through millions of pages of scientific \nmedical literature and then visualize relationships \nbetween drugs and other potential diseases.\n\nIn 2014, IBM announced that the pharmaceutical giant Johnson & Johnson and \ncompetitor Sanofi would engage in collaboration with IBM Watson\u2019s Discovery Advisor \nteam. J&J\u2019s goal is to teach the supercomputer to read and understand scientific \npapers that contain clinical trial outcomes, and then help to develop and evaluate \nmedications and other treatments. While this may not sound too exciting, it could \nhave incredible consequences on how pharmaceutical companies do comparative \neffectiveness studies.\n\nThe\u00a0IBM statement\u00a0suggests that it could help doctors to match a drug with the right \nset of patients in order to maximize effectiveness and minimize side effects. This \nwould be different to the manual process currently applied, which requires months to \nfind data and evidence before a study can even start.\n\nThe use of Watson could significantly reduce the time, and thereby accelerate the \nprocess of discovery.\u00a0MedCityNews\u00a0reported that this was the first public announcement \nof pharmaceutical companies to embrace a supercomputer\u2019s abilities and use it for \npredictive analytics towards drug development.\n\nhttp://www.ibm.com/smarterplanet/us/en/ibmwatson/\nhttps://www-03.ibm.com/press/us/en/pressrelease/44697.wss\nhttp://medcitynews.com/2014/08/pharma-puts-watson-brain-work-rd/\n\n\nwhite paper\n\nHOW WILL ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE CHANGE HEALTHCARE? 6\n\nAI for Alzheimer\u2019s Patients\n\nA\u00a0project\u00a0conducted at the University of Washington and its department of \nComputer Science explored the use of AI systems to support and enhance \nthe independence and quality of life of Alzheimer\u2019s patients. Such assisted \ncognition systems would make use of AI technology to replace some of the \nmemory and problem-solving abilities that have been lost by an Alzheimer\u2019s \npatient. According to the researchers, the motivation for this project stems \nfrom the need to promote the well-being and independence of people \nsuffering from cognitive limitations due to aging and Alzheimer\u2019s disease.\n\nAI for Wearable Health\n\nA problem with Internet of Things (IoT) applications has been how to make \nuse of their data, as computers quickly reached a limit of what could be \ndone with all that was collected.\n\nThankfully, machine-learning systems have adapted to handle larger \ncapacities of incoming data. Zulfi Alam, general manager for personal \ndevices at Microsoft, explains in a\u00a0post\u00a0that their smart upcoming \nalgorithms will know enough about the user and her biometrics in a steady \nstate to be able to recognize patterns and opportunities to improve user \nhealth and fitness.\n\nIn a more critical healthcare setting, a research team at the University \nof California, Los Angeles, proposes a\u00a0platform\u00a0for health monitoring \nusing wireless sensor networks. The platform\u2019s architecture is a network-\nenabled system that supports various wearable sensors and contains \non-board general computing capabilities for executing individually tailored \nevent detection, alerts, and network communication with various medical \ninformatics services.\n\nImagine this monitoring platform connected to artificial intelligence and \nmachine learning capabilities, and the way we take care of patients in the \nfuture could significantly change.\n\nhttps://www.cs.rochester.edu/u/kautz/papers/ac03tr.pdf\nhttps://news.microsoft.com/features/microsofts-new-cloud-powered-wearable-keeps-fitness-and-productivity-insights-a-glance-away/\nhttp://www.essp.utdallas.edu/uploads/Main/Publications/jafarir_health.pdf\n\n\nwhite paper\n\nHOW WILL ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE CHANGE HEALTHCARE? 7\n\nWhat Does the Future Hold?\n\nHealthcare professionals seem to be skeptical about the use of artificial \nintelligence in their practice. Above we presented a few use cases where \nAI could add value to healthcare, especially in areas where it could \nexcel beyond the abilities of humans. Yet, AI is still in an infant stage of \ndevelopment and will not be able to replace a doctor, writes Daniela \nHernandez of Kaiser Health News in WIRED.\n\nThe big question we may want to ask is, \u2018How can machine learning \nbecome a greater enabler for healthcare and its participating players?\u2019 The \ntime is right to ask doctors and pharmaceutical companies what problems \nthey have, and how AI could help solve them.\n\nhttp://www.wired.com/2014/06/ai-healthcare/\n\n\nAbout SoftServe\n\nSoftServe is a leading technology solutions company specializing in \nsoftware development and consultancy services.

Today \nit faces several increasingly urgent and complex challenges that will require \ninnovative solutions. Three of the most significant are increasing populations, \nescalating consumer demand, and resistance to implementing technology. \n\nBy 2050, the world\u2019s population is predicted to be close to 10 billion. Food production \nwill need to increase to sustain this growth. Yet meeting such demand will be difficult, as \nworldwide, only about 11% of land is arable, and farming areas are no longer increasing. \n\nAGRICULTURE INDUSTRY CHALLENGES \n\nINCREASING POPULATION\n\nhttps://www.un.org/development/desa/en/news/population/world-population-prospects-2019.html\nhttps://tradingeconomics.com/world/arable-land-percent-of-land-area-wb-data.html\n\n\nWhitepaper AGTECH 3\n\nPOPULATION VS ARABLE LAND\n\nAccording to experts, this means that every acre of arable farmland will need to \nincrease crop yields by approximately 70% to satisfy the population growth.  To \ndo this, the industry will need to implement disruptive technologies that lead \nto larger yields, optimized resources, and a significantly increased ROI.  \n\nFigure: By 2050 yields from available farmland need to increase 70%\n\nhttps://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/apr/01/climate-crisis-global-heating-food-farming-agriculture\n\n\nWhitepaper AGTECH 4\n\nAnother factor contributing to the critical need for AgTech solutions \nand implementation is the increasing consumer demand for \n\u201ccleaner\u201d food and transparency along the supply chain. \n\nThese demands aren\u2019t just millennials being picky. A growing percentage of \nshoppers\u2014including 58% in the US alone\u2014insist on organic or clean food.  \n\nWhether we\u2019re talking about concerns over pesticides and cancer, \nallergic reactions, the rise of celiac disease, or fears about contaminated \nirrigation water leading to disease outbreaks\u2014consumer health \nincreasingly depends on having access to safe, trustworthy food.  \n\nAmazon\u2019s acquisition of Whole Foods and Walmart\u2019s entrance to the organics game \nprove that big business is responding to consumer demand for natural food. In \nfact, Walmart is now one of the biggest organic grocers in North America.  \n\nBut with less than 1% of domestic farmland being certified organic, \nthe United States is struggling to meet the demand, leading to \nAmericans spending $1 billion a year to import organic foods. \n\nESCALATING CONSUMER DEMAND \n\nhttps://www.organicconsumers.org/news/58-us-consumers-prefer-organic-food-survey-says\nhttps://www.naturalproductsinsider.com/regulatory/consumer-interest-organic-food-rises\nhttps://www.nbcnews.com/news/asian-america/why-indias-punjab-state-has-countrys-highest-cancer-rates-n158691\nhttps://www.cbc.ca/news/health/romaine-lettuce-e-coli-1.4727993\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/16/business/dealbook/amazon-whole-foods.html\nhttps://www.thebalancesmb.com/organic-retailers-in-north-america-2011-2538129\nhttps://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2019/01/10/organic-farming-is-on-the-rise-in-the-u-s/\nhttps://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2019/01/10/organic-farming-is-on-the-rise-in-the-u-s/\n\n\nWhitepaper AGTECH 5\n\nCompounding these dilemmas is the fact that the agricultural industry is the \nleast-digitized sector worldwide. While Agtech startup investments reached \n$31 billion in 2020, this influx of support is a very recent development. \n\nFactors such as an aging farmer population, costs, uneven rates of implementation, and a \nlack of understanding on how best to use the data collected have slowed the adoption of \ntechnology. With Agtech expected to generate more than $17 billion by 2026, it\u2019s clear that \nthings are moving in the right direction. But the delay in taking advantage of these tools \nand technologies means the overall agriculture industry will need to make up for lost time. \n\nRESISTANCE TO TECHNOLOGICAL TRANSFORMATION \n\nhttps://www.feednavigator.com/Article/2019/10/22/Agriculture-is-ripe-for-disruption\nhttps://agfunder.com/\nhttps://agfunder.com/\nhttps://agfunder.com/\nhttps://blog.familyfarmsgroup.com/why-are-some-family-farms-resisting-technology-and-how-will-that-fuel-consolidation-in-row-crops\nhttps://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/global-smart-agriculture-market-to-reach-17-1-billion-by-2026--301323285.html\n\n\nWhitepaper AGTECH 6\n\nThere are seven main Agtech solution areas, many of which overlap. Both separately \nand combined, these solutions incorporate tools and technologies that seek to \naddress this sector\u2019s growing challenges.IoT frequently provides the digitally enabled \nfoundation for other solutions such as robotics, sensors, drones, and GPS.\n\nINTERNET OF THINGS  (IOT) \n\nIoT solutions in this sector combine specialized equipment, wireless technology, \nand software. Its purpose is to help reduce waste, manual labor, and costs while \nincreasing overall yields and productivity. Devices may include several sensors \nthat measure a range of parameters impacting crops, such as the soil\u2019s \nmoisture and temperature or the ground\u2019s electrical conductivity. \n\nAll this data allows for real-time monitoring of crop status. It also provides \nthe needed information for statistical modeling. This modeling can be \nused to predict watering or fertilizing needs or production output, so the \nappropriate resources are allocated accurately to maximize the yield. \n\nIoT frequently provides the digitally enabled foundation for \nother robotic, sensor, drone, and GPS solutions.\n\nSOLUTIONS INCLUDE\n\nAGTECH SOLUTIONS SEEK TO SOLVE INDUSTRY \nCHALLENGES\u00a0\n\n\n\nWhitepaper AGTECH 7\n\nHigh-tech sensors measure an array of \nelements in support of greater overall \nsuccess. These devices include pH sensors \nthat can pinpoint the presence or absence \nof nutrients in the soil to optimize a crop\u2019s \ngrowth. Temperature sensors can monitor \nwhen the soil or air becomes too hot or too \ncold for that specific crop and alert farmers. \n\nThe more accurate the data in farming and \nagriculture, the better enabled farmers are \nto respond. Sensors provide the means for \nsome of the most accurate real-time data. \n\nGenerally, GPS is used to precisely map out \nfarmland and fields. By having a method \nfor efficient geospatial data analysis, \nfarmers can more accurately determine the \nimpact of production methods or notice \nany alarming crop issues. It also allows for \nprecise seed placement on the best parts of \nthe farmland to increase overall yield. GPS \ncan also help guide other tools such as the \nMonarch Tractor\u2014a \u201csmart\u201d tractor that is \ndriver-optional\u2014to the correct location.  \n\nThese highly detailed maps are often \ncombined with other solutions like \nIoT or machine learning to further \nassess changes, solve problems, \npredict outcomes, and provide data. \n\nSENSORS AND ACTUATORS \n\nGEO-POSITIONING SYSTEMS (GPS)  \n\nhttps://www.precisionag.com/market-watch/first-fully-electric-smart-tractor-makes-debut/\n\n\nWhitepaper AGTECH 8\n\nThe Agtech sector is slowly incorporating \nthe use of drones and unmanned aircraft, \nmost commonly to capture crop images. \nThese images are later analyzed with \nsoftware programs that indicate how \nthe crops are evolving. Drones have \nbeen used less frequently as remote \nfertilizing vehicles, but this practice \nhas been on the rise as better GPS \ntools and sensors become available. \n\nLike all \u201csmart\u201d solutions, data is \nrequired for success. But data alone \nisn\u2019t valuable if you can\u2019t draw insight \nfrom it. Big data and machine learning \ntransform raw information into actionable \ninsights using outcomes from other \nsolutions such as satellite and drone \nimagery or soil and moisture probes. \n\nIoT devices and sensors also help in the \ndata collection phase. These tools can \nbe placed in tractors, trucks, fields, soil, \nand plants to aid the collection of real-\ntime data directly from the ground.  \n\nAfter collecting all the data, analysts \nuse other available information\u2014such \nas weather or pricing models\u2014in the \ncloud to determine patterns.  Analysts \ncan be actual humans or an outgrowth \nof machine learning algorithms. \n\nThe pinpointed patterns and insights \ncan help identify existing issues, \nlike operational inefficiencies and \nproblems with soil quality. They can also \nformulate predictive algorithms to alert \nfarmers before a problem occurs. \n\nDRONES AND IMAGE \nRECOGNITION ANALYTICS \n\nBIG DATA AND \nMACHINE LEARNING \n\nhttp://capture crop images\n\n\nWhitepaper AGTECH 9\n\nCOVID-19 accelerated the use of robotics in agriculture as industry leaders \nrequired ways to continue production with less face-to-face interaction. \nUsing technologies and solutions such as sensors, GPS, IoT, and more, \nhas led to the increased use of driverless tractors and other tools. \n\nIt\u2019s also spurred innovative efforts like the Autonomous Weeder, which \ncombines robotics, artificial intelligence (AI), and laser technology to \nnavigate fields and identify, target, and eliminate weeds. As this technology \nonly continues to improve, innovations are continually expanding.  \n\nFor example, the University of North Florida College of Computing, Engineering, \nand Construction department has teamed up with the University of Central \nFlorida to build multiple autonomous robots. These robots will communicate \nwirelessly to perform tasks like harvesting crops or applying fertilizer. This \nproject aims to create a prototype of a \u201cmulti-robot agricultural information \ncollection system\u201d that can support future Agtech solutions. \n\nAdvanced farm machinery that allows for precise and streamlined farming, measurements, \nprocesses, and more combines many solutions\u2014such as robotics, IoT, drones, sensors, \nGPS\u2014to perform their work. Machinery such as the Autonomous Weeder or GPS \nguided tractors mentioned above significantly improve the speed of once lengthy, \nmanual tasks. Sensors in irrigation systems relay feedback on the soil\u2019s needs and \nallow for precise delivery of the nutrients and moisture for every piece of farmland. \n\nAll seven of these solution areas provide the technology and tools to \nhelp solve current agricultural challenges and address new ones. \n\nROBOTICS \n\nPRECISION EQUIPMENT \n\nhttps://www.precisionag.com/market-watch/carbon-robotics-disrupts-farming-industry-with-autonomous-weeders/\nhttps://www.growingproduce.com/vegetables/research-of-autonomous-farm-robotics-ramps-up-in-florida/\n\n\nWhitepaper AGTECH 10\n\nLike the seven main categories of solutions, the terms used to describe \nthis sector also overlap, with Smart Farming, Smart Agriculture, \nand Precision Agriculture often used interchangeably.  \n\nTo clarify the differences between the terms, one must look at the focus that guides them.  \n\nGETTING PRECISE ABOUT THE SMART AG SECTOR  \n\nSMART AGRICULTURE \n\nFigure: By 2025, Precision Agriculture will be the largest segment of Smart Agriculture. \n\nSMART AGRICULTURE MARKET OVERVIEW\n\nM\nar\n\nke\nt S\n\niz\ne \n\n(U\nSD\n\n M\nill\n\nio\nn)\n\n2019 2025 (projection)\n\n\n\nWhitepaper AGTECH 11\n\nHere, the key focus is on using IoT as a mechanism to connect sensors and \nmachines. This complex system then manages farm functions based on the data it \nreceives. It provides farmers remote monitoring options so they can make strategic \ndecisions and take action via their tablet, phone, or other mobile devices.  \n\nThe goal is to increase the quality and quantity of the crops \nwhile optimizing the human labor used. Examples of the \ntools and technologies used in smart agriculture include: \n\n\u2022 Precision irrigation and precise plant nutrition \n\n\u2022 Greenhouse climate management and control  \n\n\u2022 Sensors for the soil, water, light, moisture, \nand temperature management \n\n\u2022 Software, analytics, and optimization platforms \n\n\u2022 Location systems using GPS, satellite, and more \n\n\u2022 Communication systems based on mobile \nconnection, LoraWan, or others \n\n\u2022 Robots \n\nSmart agriculture refers to farms using solutions, technologies, and \ntools such as sensors, location systems, robots, IoT, and AI.  \n\nhttps://ondo.io/what-is-precision-irrigation/\n\n\nWhitepaper AGTECH 12\n\nSmart farming is optimizing complex farming systems by applying information \nand data technologies. Unlike Precision Agriculture, smart farming focuses \non the access to data and the application of this data. In other words, how \ncan the collected information be used smartly and strategically? \n\nA segment of Smart Agriculture, precision agriculture is defined by the \nEuropean Parliament as \u201ca modern farming management concept using digital \ntechniques to monitor and optimize agricultural production processes.\u201d    \n\nThe key here is the focus on optimization. For example, farmers have previously applied \nequal amounts of fertilizer across their entire field. A farmer can measure the field\u2019s soil \nvariations using precision agriculture and adapt their fertilizer strategy accordingly. This \nleads to optimized fertilizer usage, cost savings, and a reduced environmental impact. \n\nSMART FARMING \n\nPRECISION AGRICULTURE \n\n\n\nWhitepaper AGTECH 13\n\nThe shift towards precision agriculture and its focus on optimization has \nbecome increasingly vital to respond to the market and resource forces. \n\nPRECISION AGRICULTURE\n\nPrecision agriculture is a farming \nmanagement concept based on \nobserving, measuring, and responding \nto crop inter-and intra-field variability.\n\nPRECISION AGRICULTURE WILL POINT THE WAY \n\nFigure: The segments of Precision Agriculture \n\n\u2022 Yield Monitoring\n\n\u2022 Field Soil Mapping\n\n\u2022 Data integration\n\n\u2022 Crop Scouting\n\n\u2022 Weather Tracking & Forecasting\n\n\u2022 Irrigation Management\n\n\u2022 Inventory Management\n\n\u2022 Farm Labor Management\n\n\u2022 Financial Management\n\n\u2022 Fertility & Diseases Management\n\n\n\nWhitepaper AGTECH 14\n\nGlobal navigation satellite (GNSS)/GPS systems currently represent the \nlargest technology segment of precision agriculture. As the accuracy of \nthese technologies has improved, it\u2019s enabled a large-scale adoption \nof precision agriculture for geo-positioning and field mapping.  \n\nIn terms of precision agriculture's earth-bound tools, automation and control \nsystems are mostly preferred as they help minimize labor and electricity costs. \n\nHardware components account for most of the market share, as their \nconsistent evolution has resulted in new devices being introduced \nwith enhanced location and data processing capabilities.  \n\nYield monitoring represents the biggest segment of applications, followed by crop scouting, \nmapping, soil monitoring, and precision irrigation. Yield monitoring systems measure \nand record information based on the grain flow, grain moisture, and farm area covered. \n\nThis combination of applications, technology, hardware, and systems as \npart of precision agriculture will help to solve the two biggest challenges \nof the agriculture industry. First, it addresses the needs of an increasing \npopulation utilizing tools such as IoT, sensors, robotics, and more to increase \ncrop yields, decrease waste, and identify areas for expansion. \n\nNext, precision agriculture can respond to escalating consumer transparency \ndemands by implementing systems such as blockchain that ensure clarity \nthroughout the supply chain. It also allows for tracing and identifying \npotential food safety concerns to address the problem at its source. \n\n\n\nWhitepaper AGTECH 15\n\nAgricultural companies can no longer wait to digitize. Digital transformation is \nrequired in order to remain competitive. Using solutions, tools, and technologies \nsuch as IoT, sensor nodes, drones, field data analysis, and connected farming \nequipment will help the industry meet increasing global demand. It will also \nensure sustainability and minimize negative impacts on the environment. \n\nBut these solutions won\u2019t provide those results if they aren\u2019t implemented properly \nand with a deep understanding of their best performance possibilities.

And with the business rapidly \nexpanding within Vietnam, One Mount \nrecently found itself needing to make \ncareful choices to keep adapting in time \nwith its speed of growth. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nWith increasing customer need for a large \nexpansion of their existing Kubernetes \nsolution, data platform, and MLOps, the \ntime came for the company to improve \nits services with faster and more efficient \nprocesses, and to scale with an emphasis \non a growing focus on cloud operations. \nOne Mount also needed to make sure it \ndeveloped security appropriately around \nall these changes. \n \nDue to the sheer scale and speed the  \nproject needed to help One Mount maintain \n\nthe lead in its field, it needed to partner \nwith a company that had expertise and \nexperience in these kinds of infrastructure \nimprovements \u2014 as well as a firm grip on \nbest practices to offer the best advice on \ncontinuing the journey. Enter SoftServe. \nOne Mount had already reached out to \nSoftServe in March 2021 for TAM (technical \naccount management) services, but as the \nconversations and workshops deepened, \nand these newer needs were considered, \nboth companies realized a wider and more \nnuanced approach could achieve \namazing results.\n\n \nThe Solution: \nwhen Dev meets Ops\n\nOne Mount and SoftServe began \nto plan the best way to make this \ngrowing infrastructure best-in-class. \n\nOn a basic level, the project was all about \nreducing the load on the infrastructure \nteam and reducing time to market by \nmaking it easier for developers to place \nnew code on One Mount\u2019s systems.

Energy companies use diesel engines across the entire value chain, \ncontributing to the increase in global emissions. The major challenge \u2014 actual GHG \n\nemissions from oil and gas drilling rigs, fracking units, onshore equipment, or marine \nvessels are not being measured. \n\nThere is an answer. Energy industry leaders can implement an innovative emission \ntracking and reduction strategy to get actionable data-driven insights, improve long-term \nESG impact, and increase revenue. Discover how state-of-the-art cloud technologies, the \ninternet of things, and data science come together to proactively monitor emission levels, \ndetect optimization opportunities, and improve operational efficiency. \n\nClient background Business challenge\n\nTS Cyanergy (Cyanergy) is an innovative \nstartup driven by its founders\u2019 motivation \nto address a drawback in the global \nemission tracking approach. Energy \ncompanies tend to calculate approximate \nemissions based on the volume of \npurchased fuel and data tables provided \nby the engine manufacturer or by manual \nmeasures of fuel consumption recorded \nby hand. This approach does not reveal \nthe actual level of emissions; thus, these \nmethods may over-report emissions based \non conservative one size fits all situations \nconversions.  \n\nCyanergy offers energy companies that \nwant to reduce emission levels a unique \nsolution that combines the installation of \ntheir sensor-based equipment to measure \nemission levels along with the engines\u2019 \npower load and state-of-the-art custom \nsoftware to aggregate data for onsite \nmanagement and ESG reports. \n\nThe absence of appropriate emissions \ntracking and measuring combined with \nthe poorly optimized power load of diesel \nengines generates additional issues for \nteams on a rig or a platform, such as \nthe inefficient use of engine resources \nand excessive fuel consumption. These \nproblems result in increased emission of \nthree main GHGs: methane (CH4), carbon \ndioxide CO2, and nitrous oxide (N2O) into \nthe atmosphere.  \n\nCurrently, there is a problem with \nmeasuring the amount of these gases \nand reducing the emissions to the norms \nand rules established by the regulators. \nNot solving the problem of hydrocarbon \nemissions can lead to significant financial \nlosses, inefficient engine power usage, and \ndecreased employee motivation.  \n\ncase study |   Data-Driven Emissions Optimization With a Cloud-Based Solution 2\n\n\n\nTS Cyanergy partnered with SoftServe to develop a custom software solution that \nleverages the power of Cyanergy\u2019s sensors.

They\u2019re \nknown as innovators. Therefore, it \nwasn\u2019t surprising when they began, \nas they describe, \"to tackle the \nchallenges of agriculture with new \ntechnologies.\"\n\nAfter thoroughly analyzing disruptive \nagriculture technologies, our \ncustomer pursued advanced vertical \nfarming techniques. However, they \nquickly discovered that growing their \nproduct in vertical farms would be \nsignificantly less profitable than \ncontinuing to grow it as usual\u2014on \nfree land. \n\nThe question was asked: Could \nthe production expertise and skills \ngained in their traditional farming \npractices help them step into a new \nbusiness\u2014growing new produce \ntypes in vertical farms located close \nto their consumers?  \n\nThe answer: Yes, but only if the \noperating costs of growing new \ncrops in the vertical farm are lower \nthan growing them using traditional \nagricultural practices.  \n\nRunning vertical farms on a \nproduction scale can be expensive \nif it involves manual operations. \nDedicated resources performing \nroutine tasks are cost prohibitive \nin countries with high salary rates. \nTherefore, our client decided to \ninvest in a research and development \n(R&D) initiative to automate manual \ntasks inside the vertical farming \ncontainer, making it economically \nattractive.   \n\nThey chose SoftServe as their \nstrategic innovation partner for \nthis project and made SoftServe\u2019s \nrobotics and engineering team their \nR&D team.  \n\nTypically, R&D for a \nrobotics project is costly \nand out of reach for \nmany organizations. \nSoftServe designed, tested, \nprototyped, and built the \nrobotics hardware and \nautomation platform \nremotely. Our experts used \na robotics simulation to gain \nearly feedback that allowed \nus to reduce the number \nof physical prototype \niterations\u2014significantly \nreducing project costs.   \n\nIt was a great success.  \n\nJoin me as I briefly discuss \nvertical farming, walk \nthrough the SoftServe \nVertical Farming Robot \nProject, and explain \nwhy designing hardware \nremotely is a big deal for \nmanufacturing companies.\n\nWHY SOFTSERVE?\nThere aren\u2019t many companies like SoftServe, with a \nproven record of successfully delivering complex end-\nto-end solutions involving both hardware and software \ncomponents\u2014from advisory through prototyping to the \nactual product launch and support. \n\n\n\nV ertical farming is a way \nof growing food indoors, \ntypically in multistory \n\nbuildings stacked with growing \ncontainers.

Simply put, running a vertical \nfarm is significantly more expensive \nthan traditional farming.   \n\nThere are many reasons why it's so \nexpensive, and the vertical farming \nWikipedia page provides an excellent \noverview of the advantages and \nproblems.   \n\nIn our customer\u2019s case, the business \nmodel requires their vertical farms \nto be in relatively high-priced \nliving areas, making hiring the \npeople to run the farms expensive. \nVertical farming containers without \nadvanced technologies are labor \nintensive, requiring manual seeding, \ntransplanting, and harvesting.  \n\nSoftServe\u2019s robotics and \nengineering experts \npartnered with our \ncustomer\u2019s agricultural \ngurus to design and build \nrobotics and advanced \nsoftware technologies for \nthe selected configuration \nof the vertical farming \ncontainer, automating as \nmany farming tasks as \npossible. The intended \nresult is to reduce the costs \nof personnel needed to \nrun the vertical farm and \nmake growing crops in the \nvertical farm profitable. \n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertical_farming\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertical_farming\n\n\nCase Study   |    Top European Food Producer Explores Robotics and Automation on the Vertical Farm 4\n\nHOW IT WORKS AND WHY IT\u2019S SO REVOLUTIONARY \nIN AGRICULTURAL PRACTICES. \n\nT he goal of the ongoing  \nproject is to design a custom \nrobot to achieve full-scale \n\nautomation inside the vertical \nfarming container, so it becomes an \nautonomous unit entirely controlled \nby technology. Once completed, \nvertical farming becomes a more \nviable farming option.\n\nSoftServe built a pre-programmed \nrobot in simulation consisting of \na static platform with a movable \nrobotic arm.

The current implementation of \nthe robot took over about 80% of the \n\nactivities that were previously done \nmanually, e.g., the monitoring of \nplants and transplanting of plants. \n\nTHE SOFTSERVE \nVERTICAL FARMING \nROBOT  \n\n\n\nCase Study   |    Top European Food Producer Explores Robotics and Automation on the Vertical Farm 5\n\n1\n2\n\n3\n4\n\nEach iteration of the design was \nfocused on:  \n\nThe team came up with a custom solution that can easily plug into the existing container environment, \nprove its feasibility within the known set of constraints, and generate the following values: \n\nFinding the best ways of moving \nthe robot in a restricted space and \nfollowing safety regulations without \nimpacting the environment itself.  \n\nEnsuring the arm is stable  \nenough to reach out of the container's high \nwalls.  \n\nDesigning the proper  \nhardware solution allowing the robot \nto pick up the seedlings without \ndamaging them and reliably fix them \ninto the vertical panel. \n\nCombining different camera \nconfigurations and lighting setups to \nachieve proper photo resolution. \n\nThe next iteration is about achieving full-scale \nautomation, including seeding and harvesting. \n\nAlthough this project is just one part of the bigger \nvision of making the vertical farming business even \n\"smarter\" using AI and ML technologies, it's one of \nthe most crucial first steps. \n\nTHE VERTICAL \nFARMING \nROBOT\u2019S VALUE \n\nThe automated transplanting \nprocess minimizes the overall \ntime spent by the operator \ninside the container. \n\nProvide a prototype for \njustifying investments \nin the vertical farming \nbusiness in target markets \nwith high salary rates. \n\nA combination of reduced \nlabor costs and other factors \n(such as solution scalability \nand automation of different \nprocesses) makes our solution \nprofitable over a few years. \n\nReduced the farm\u2019s energy consumption by \ndoing fast plant diagnostics based on the plant \nsnapshots, which allows for keeping the robot in \nan energy-saving mode longer. \n\nIn traditional farming, there was no way to \ntake photos of each plant and observe its \ngrowth at different stages. In the vertical \nfarm, this is done with image recognition and \nlight control with a cost of only 1 cent per \nsalad to take a picture daily throughout the \nplant\u2019s lifecycle. \n\nEnabled new cost-efficient operations \nthat were previously physically \nimpossible.\n\nAccording to \nthe test  \nresults, \nthe level of \nachieved \nprecision in \nplant detection \nand size \nmeasurements \nis more than \n90%. \n\nEnabled \ncontinuous \nand accurate \nplant data \ncollection.\n\n\n\nCase Study   |    Top European Food Producer Explores Robotics and Automation on the Vertical Farm 6\n\nTHE ANSWER TO MAKING CUSTOMIZED ROBOTICS \nMORE AFFORDABLE.\n\nROBOTICS \nPROJECTS DONE \nREMOTELY\n\nW e designed, built, and \ntested a solution, \nincluding hardware and \n\nsoftware components, entirely from \nscratch while running the project \nremotely. This is a big deal for \nmanufacturing companies. \n\nRunning this project with our client \nthrough purely online collaboration \nallowed the most experienced and \n\nskilled people from both sides to work \non the tasks. As you would expect, \nthere were challenges along the way, \nbut together we found ways to work \nefficiently by using collaboration tools \nlike video and 3D simulation.   \n\nDesigning and testing the vertical \nfarming robot was a yearlong process \nthat would have been impossible \nfor the customer or SoftServe if \n\nengineering resources had to be \non-site for an entire year. When the \nrobot is ready to be piloted, only a \nsmall team of engineers and the robot \nneed to travel, allowing for significantly \nreduced travel expenses for such a \nchallenging and innovative project. \n\nResearch and development of \nhardware solutions, like robots, was \nout of reach for most manufacturers \n\ndue to the number of iterations \ndone during research and the cost of \nin-person collaboration. SoftServe\u2019s \nexperience and expertise in robotics \nallowed us to design the custom robot \nremotely and reduce the number of \nphysical iterations needed, significantly \nreducing costs. Custom robotics is now \navailable to any manufacturer. The \npossibilities are endless.\n\n\n\nCase Study   |    Top European Food Producer Explores Robotics and Automation on the Vertical Farm 7\n\n03Using gathered plant data in different ways across the enterprise, (e.g., to simulate the plant's \nbehavior over time with the help of a digital twin, figure out the most profitable crop breeding \nand cultivation techniques, and proactively impact the growing process). \n\nFINAL \nTHOUGHTS\u2014\nUNLOCKED \nOPPORTUNITIES \nThe superior teamwork used to design the vertical farming robot also \nunlocked new opportunities for this client, such as: \n\n01Applying capabilities created in the scope of \nthis initiative in other business areas (i.e., using \ncomputer vision for better weeding practices). \n\n02Exploring new markets with \nhigh labor costs for business \nexpansion. \n\nThe SoftServe Vertical Farming \nRobot Project was just the \nbeginning of our client\u2019s journey \nto entering a new business, \nscaling it, continuously \nimproving it, and inventing \nmore disruptive solutions.

On a computer, Virtual Reality is primarily \nexperienced through two of the five senses: sight and sound.\n\nThere was a slow trickle of AR/VR investments from 2006 until late 2014. \nThen Magic Leap raised $542 million from Google and other tech giants \nbecoming a starting gun for investment acceleration, with nearly $1 billion \nbeing poured into the sector in 2015, according to Digi Capital. \n\nWith Samsung Gear VR, Oculus, PlayStation VR and others set to hit the \nmarket, 2016 is going to be a big year for virtual reality. The industry is \nexpected to see a big windfall over the next few years, and a report from \nTrendForce estimates that the virtual reality market could grow to US$70 \nbillion in 2020. \n\nBesides VR headsets, the VR applications and games market is growing, as \nis VR content, and consumer 3D cameras are approaching the market. The \narea where VR can be used is very wide: Military, Education, Healthcare, \nEntertainment, Fashion, Heritage, Business, Engineering, Sport, Media, \nScientific Visualization, Telecommunications, Construction, Film, and \nProgramming Languages \u2013 even the sky is not the limit.\n\nDuring our investigation at SoftServe, we tend to work with\u00a0Unity \nIDE\u00a0and\u00a0Oculus SDK. Some of our demo projects were related to porting \nexisting games into VR or porting real CAD objects into a VR Scene.\n\nOut of a wide range of technology trends that are rocking today\u2019s market, \nthe Internet of Things seems to develop at the greatest possible speed. \n\nhttp://press.trendforce.com/node/prints/2210\nhttp://press.trendforce.com/node/prints/2210\nhttps://unity3d.com/\nhttps://unity3d.com/\nhttps://developer.oculus.com/\n\n\nThe IoT Service Offering\n\nAt SoftServe we understand that the concept of the IoT is not enough; also knowing how \n\nto design for it, targeting both humans and machines, is essential.

Everyone who runs, bikes, or plays any \nsport for fun or professionally. An estimated 1.6 million \namateur and 12,000 professional athletes are in the U.S. \n\nalone. They\u2019re members of teams and clubs or compete individually. \nEach sport differs, but athletes at any level share the same goal: \nto support the sport they love. \n \nThe preferred place for this is online. SoftServe gave a hand to one \nsuch U.S.-based social media platform with a unique approach. \nOur client wanted to help amateur and professional athletes \nbecome sports legends.\n\n\n\nCase Study   |   SoftServe Creates Mobile App for Social Media Platform 3\n\nCHALLENGE\n\nT heir vision was to create a social media platform where ath-\nletes could discuss everything about their sport, including \ntraining techniques, performance, and successes.

Private wealth management requires direct \ninteraction of the advisee with a financial advisor who assesses information, \ntrends, and market sentiment to develop potential investment strategies.     \n\nBut this model is hardly scalable with the growing quantity of transactions in \nthe market and is losing its prime position to automated solutions featuring \nintegrated algorithms and streaming data processing.\n\nA solution that brings reliability, convenience, transparency and accessibility \ninto managing private wealth investments by utilizing big data, artificial \nintelligence and business intelligence can meet the evolving needs of \na dynamic market.\n\n\n\ncase study | Private wealth management solution for choosing optimal asset allocations 2\n\nBusiness Challenge\n\nIndividual investors place a great emphasis on the reliability of their financial advisory \nwhen making investment decisions. Smarter, more transparent software algorithms \nultimately translate to higher investor confidence when making assets allocation decisions. \nCustomers also show increasing interest in having quick access to their financial holdings, \ncircumventing the hurdles of a traditional financial advisory or broker. \n\nAnother challenge is that as a portfolio becomes increasingly comprised of different assets, \nits dynamics becomes more complex. Investors are looking for a forecast of these future \ndynamics for a given portfolio, as well as recommendations for products that have large \nupside potential with minimal risk. Providing reliable data for customers supports and guides \nthem in developing their personal investing strategy and custom portfolio composition.\n\nProject Description\n\nThough forecasting capabilities already play an increasing role in high-frequency trading, it \nis not as common in consumer portfolio management systems. SoftServe aimed to merge \nthose to bring more value to managing individual investor assets.\n\nThe solution was designed to cover two big blocks, known to be critical for wealth \nmanagement decisions:\n\nStock price predictions \u2013 calculating the potential future gains or losses in value of a \nparticular share.\n\nPortfolio optimization \u2013 the tool uses smart algorithm to analyze the predicted time-\nseries for a set of shares and defines asset allocation options that will align with user \nrequirements to risk tolerance and desirable profitability.\n\nSoftServe R&D team decided to make a commonly used algorithm even smarter than \nbefore having included market signals, corporate network, and sentiments analysis as a \npart of the input data for the analyzing function.\n\nAs a result, the algorithm uses a few types of input parameters for conducting the \nindividual stock price prediction:\n\n1. historical data on stock prices, volume history, and market average \n2. sentiment analysis index based on reliable news sources \n3. network science to embrace corporate network effects\n\n\n\ncase study | Private wealth management solution for choosing optimal asset allocations 3\n\nThis covers both the quantitative and qualitative parameters influencing the future price. \n\nThe product provides individual investors with three alternative portfolio strategies to \nfollow, with respect to the level of risk and returns:\n\n\u2022 an optimal strategy\n\u2022 a minimum risk strategy\n\u2022 highest returns strategy (highest risk)\n\nPredictions for the current portfolio structure is also provided.\n\n\n\ncase study | Private wealth management solution for choosing optimal asset allocations 4\n\nValue Delivered\n\nThe product addresses two main issues that customers search for when managing \npersonal investments. \n\nFirstly, the reliability of the advice they receive from a financial adviser, whether via an \nautomated solution or a live expert. SoftServe\u2019s smart algorithm brings transparency \nto the advising process. It incorporates not only an approach based on historical series \n(accessible for live advisory), but also processes large volumes of correlated data from \nthe market in real time with a high degree of calculation accuracy, helping to assure an \ninvestor in their certainty of decision making.\n\nSecondly, accessibility and convenience. The voice enabled personal assistant in \nSoftServe\u2019s private wealth management solution is able to seamlessly lead customers \nthrough the whole investing journey up to placing an order to a broker as aligned with \na chosen strategy. The smart algorithm is integrated into the user-friendly interface and \nworks with the Amazon Alexa Echo Show to bring the investing interaction experience \nwith a robo-adviser to a whole new level.\n\n\n\nUSA HQ\nTel: 1-512-516-8880\nToll free: 866-687-3588\n\nEUROPEAN HQ\nTel: +380-32-240-9090\nToll free: 0-8006-0-8006\n\ninfo@softserveinc.com\nwww.softserveinc.com\n\nABOUT US\nSoftServe is a global digital authority and consulting company, operating \nat the cutting edge of technology.

It\u2019s true that innovation brings the \nrisk of demise to a predecessor (in cases where necessary adaptability and agility are \nabsent), but it doesn\u2019t have to be an either/or proposition.\n\nSuch is the case with FinTech firms and existing financial institutions like banks and credit \nunions. Instead of viewing disruptors as competitors, financial services companies\u2014\nespecially global conglomerates who lack the agility needed for innovation at the speed \nof digital\u2014should embrace collaboration to enhance service and experiences for today\u2019s \ndigital consumer.\n\nMajor players in the industry that have been quick to adapt, do not view the exponential \ngrowth in popularity of FinTech firms to be a challenge, but rather, an opportunity.\n\nWhen the longevity, product variety, and customer base of financial institutions is \ncombined with the data enrichment, user experience, and modern platforms that quality \nFinTech firms provide\u2014the results can be highly beneficial for both the consumer and \ncollaborators.\n\nBased on projected technology investments for 2018, the benefit of FinTech integration \nwith legacy systems is not lost on the financial establishment.\n\n\n\nwhitepaper | Why Legacy Financial Should Embrace FinTech 3\n\nLife is easier (and more secure) with FinTech\n\nFinTech firms bring new and improved products and systems for leveraging by traditional \ninstitutions for improved performance and increased profitability. This is achieved by using \nstate of the art technologies and secure networks that speed up credit card processing, \nmoney transfers, and loan processing\u2014more securely and with less friction points for the \nconsumer.\n\nTake digital wallets for instance. Traditionally when traveling abroad, one spends \ncrucial time searching for exchanges and paying extra fees at the airport to convert \ncurrency. Multi-currency, digital wallets provide clickable access to all financial accounts, \nautomatically convert, and carry out transactions faster and more securely\u2014with no need \nto carry a physical wallet. An example of this is CashDash, a mobile app that allows one to \nbuy, collect, and return foreign currency.\n\nThere are also cryptocurrencies running on blockchain distributed ledger technology (DLT). \nBitcoin is the most widely known but there are currently thousands of others in circulation. \nThese are and will continue to have a key impact in the financial world and governments \nare already getting involved in formulating legislation around it. This is especially true with \ntrading exchanges, and also Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs)\u2014an alternative form of crowd \nfunding\u2014that have enabled many companies to acquire the funds needed to start their \nbusinesses.\n\nDIGITAL WALLET APPSHOP\n\nBANK\n\nPAYMENT\n\nBANK ACCOUNT\n\nADD MONEY\n\nFrom bank account\n(convert to e-money)\n\nvia QR or\nbar code\n\nTRANSFER\n\nusing electronic\nmoney\n\nCASH WITHDRAWAL\n\nusing\ne-money\n\nWith any solution, security is of course a key consideration. Consumers rightfully demand \nthat personal data, funds, and transactions are secure. FinTech provides advances in \nencryption and biometric technology\u2014with an added bonus of making login easier for the \nconsumer via facial and touch ID.\n\n\n\nwhitepaper | Why Legacy Financial Should Embrace FinTech 4\n\nFinTech + Cloud = winning\n\nHyper-personalization and genuinely customized experiences lead to higher retention and \nadvocacy in any industry. Via the Cloud, FinTech provides the agility to ingest and manage \ndata at scale, and this data provides the insights necessary to deliver the proactive service, \npersonal experience, and security today\u2019s consumers demand.\n\nEvery person appreciates having his or her needs anticipated and met before having to \nask, and being offered personally relevant products or services at precisely the right place \nand time is welcomed more often than not\u2014especially when the timely offer is delivered in \nlanguage reflecting the personality of the individual.\n\nLegacy financial services have been largely reactive. With FinTech integration, financial \ninstitutions of any size can proactively deliver the personalized experience (onsite and \nonline) that not only keeps loyal customers, but converts them into advocates and fans.\n\n17,6% 16,7% 7,7% 5,6%\nMoney transfer/ \npayments\n\nSavings/ \ninvestment\n\nInsurance Borrowing\n\nsuch as... such as... such as... such as...\n\n\u2022 use of non-banks \nto transfer money\n\n\u2022 online foreign \nexchange\n\n\u2022 overseas \nremittances\n\n\u2022 online stockbroking/ \nspreadbetting\n\n\u2022 online budgeting/ \nplanning\n\n\u2022 online investments\n\u2022 equity and rewards \n\ncrowdfunding\n\u2022 P2P\n\n\u2022 car insurance using \ntelematics\n\n\u2022 healthcare premium \naggregators\n\n\u2022 borrowing via P2P \nwebsites\n\nFinTech AI drives diversification (and lowers costs)\n\nBy 2020, 85% of all customer interactions will be accomplished without human \nintervention. At first glance, AI-driven teller/advisor automation may seem anti-\ncollaborative, but in fact, it frees human assets to focus on non-redundant tasks while \nenhancing personalization and portfolio diversification.\n\nRoboAdvisors and automated wealth management services provide clients with the \nfinancial advice they require and have become popular for people looking for low-cost and \nautomated investment opportunities.\n\n\n\nwhitepaper | Why Legacy Financial Should Embrace FinTech 5\n\nWithin minutes, RoboAdvisors can provide a personalized portfolio and provide access \nto wealth management services that could only be previously accessed by the ultra-\nwealthy. These AI-driven service providers also build diversified portfolios, automatically \nselecting investments for their clients. It\u2019s estimated that assets under management by \nRoboAdvisors will grow by 68% annually to $2.2 trillion within the next five years.\n\nAutomated trading lowers tax liability for financial services companies as well\u2014yet another \nreason to embrace FinTech integration.\n\nWhy not both?\n\nWhile disruptive to the status quo, FinTech (and digital innovation as a whole) should \nenhance, not replace traditional institutions. Some global conglomerates have taken the \napproach of competing with more agile FinTech providers, but likewise, this does not signal \nthe end of FinTech startups. If one listens to and observes what consumers want for future \nbanking, it\u2019s both.\n\nA survey from JD Power shows that the digital-savvy millennials still value the local bank \nbranch. 71% still access the local branch with an average of 11 visits per year. Having access \nto both digital accounts and local branch access with fast, convenient, and personalized \nexperiences is the key\u2014and that is more effectively accomplished with legacy and FinTech \nintegration.\n\nDominant financial players and FinTech firms can enhance each other\u2019s strengths while \ncovering respective weaknesses. Current efficiency, security, and data management \nconcerns can be turned into opportunities. For those that innovate collaboratively, the \nfuture of legacy and FinTech financial services is potentially more bullish than ever.\n\nTo learn how FinTech empowers big data, DevOps, biometric security and more, contact \nSoftServe today.\n\nhttps://www.amdocs.com/blog/mobile-financial-services/banking-bots-how-virtual-agents-and-robo-advisors-are-disrupting\nhttps://www.amdocs.com/blog/mobile-financial-services/banking-bots-how-virtual-agents-and-robo-advisors-are-disrupting\nhttps://softserveinc.com/en-us/contact/\nhttps://softserveinc.com/en-us/contact/\n\n\nABOUT US\nSoftServe is a digital authority that advises and provides at the cutting-\nedge of technology.

In addition, achieving \nbusiness velocity requires deployment automation as well, for \nwhich Google Cloud Platform (GCP) is a solid choice.\n\nHowever, to be ready to run business application in GCP cloud, \nour client had to maintain compliance with internal security \npolicies based on NIST SP 800-53 recommendations.\n\nOIL AND GAS COMPANY RUNS \nIN THE CLOUD WITH NIST \nSECURITY COMPLIANCE\n\n\n\ncase study |    Oil and Gas Company Runs in the Cloud with NIST Security Compliance 2\n\nSpecific challenges overcome during this project include: \n\n\u2022 Establishing a PAM solution based on Onion ID \n\u2022 Integration with corporate AD\n\u2022 Provisioning Secure VPC\n\u2022 Provisioning Self-Managed Kubernetes Cluster\n\u2022 Selecting and Demonstrating Container Security Solution\n\u2022 Integration with other security controls\n\nProject Description\n\nAs a cloud enablement project in collaboration with Google, SoftServe needed to deploy \nthe client\u2019s environment in the GCP with all security policies met and all deployment \nprocesses fully automated.\n\nSoftServe created and demonstrated tools and ready to use scripts, host images, and \ndocumentation. The entire deployment process was based on best DevOps practices \nand tools in order to be fully automated, scalable and transferable. The templates, build \nimages and deployed infrastructure included all required security software and is fully \ncompliant with the customer\u2019s security requirements.\n\nSoftServe\u2019s experts leveraged a range of innovative cloud practices and technologies \nincluding container platforms like Kubernetes, automation and deployment tools, GCP \nspecific services and flexible API. These were a key part of every deployment stage in \ntandem with Google\u2019s cloud security recommendations and services.\n\nOne of the primary challenges faced during this project was that some of the client\u2019s \nrequired security software was not thin integrated with GCP services. But through the \ncollaborative efforts of SoftServe\u2019s highly qualified engineers, Google support and \ncomprehensive communications with customers and software vendors this issue was \naddressed and the project held on schedule.\n\n\n\ncase study |    Oil and Gas Company Runs in the Cloud with NIST Security Compliance 3\n\nBusiness Value\n\nToday our client\u2019s applications deployed in GCP are compliant with the requisite security \npolicies.

WHY NOW?\nBiometric verification is any means by which a person can be exclusively identified by \nevaluating one or more distinguishing biological traits, such as their facial or body features, \nincluding finger veins, DNA, and signatures.\n\nWith the introduction of computerized databases and the digitization of analog data, \nbiometric verification has become significantly more innovative, allowing for almost \ninstantaneous identification. Therefore, the fundamentals of these biometric methods are \nhardly ever needed to be treated or classed as new or modern. For example, iris-pattern \nand retina-pattern authentication methods are already used in some bank ATM machines.\n\nAs devices have become more affordable and user-friendly, the use of biometric \nidentification has become common, while at the same time software algorithms have \nbecome smarter and considerably more reliable too.\n\nTimes have certainly changed. A few decades ago, when referring to printed currency \nnotes, people would have said \u201cI have\u201d, as in to say that they \u201chave\u201d the money with \nthem. Nowadays, this can also be expanded to a \u201cI have and I know\u201d statement. What do \nwe mean by this? Well, for example, let\u2019s say we have a credit card and a password that \naccompanies it. Nowadays, that narrative of \u201cI have\u201d can be used to refer to the credit card, \nwhile the \u201cI know\u201d can be used to refer to the password that goes with the credit card (as in \nthey \u201cknow\u201d what the password is).\n\n\n\nwhitepaper | Biometric Identification 3\n\nPossessing a credit card is definitely more convenient than carrying cash; however, there \nare still some disadvantages of carrying one, such as it is easy to lose one. But what if the \n\u201cI know\u201d part of the algorithm (i.e. a password in this case) is stolen? Then the problem \nbecomes rather serious and complicated. This is where biometric identification can help \nbecause the information can store data and can help the user to get back any lost data.\n\nBiometrics in personal identification has become quite attractive because it operates \nwithin the \u201cI have\u201d model. Effectively, biometric identification makes it easier for individuals \nto have their data carried along since it is naturally embedded and, thus, it is very difficult \nto lose. No matter what biometric methodology is used, the identification verification \nprocess remains the same wherever you go because a record of a person's unique \ncharacteristic is captured and kept in a database.\n\nWhenever that stored biometric identification data is required (i.e. the \u201cI have\u201d) , a new \nrecord is captured and compared with the previous record in the database. If, for whatever \nreason, the data in the new record matches that in the database record, the person's \nidentity is confirmed.\n\nTable 1 below shows a list of some of the most popular biometric identification features, \nand their types. This list is not comprehensive by all means. \n\nFace\nFingerprint\nIris\nRetina\nDNA\nFinger vein / palm vein\nVoice\nElectrocardiogram\nBioimpedance\nGate\nKeystroke\nSignature\n\nFEATURE\nTYPE\n\nTable 1: List of the major biometric methods\n\nCHARACTERISTIC BEHAVIORAL\n\nEach biometric method has advantages and disadvantages, as well as different fields of \napplication. For example, DNA profiling is undoubtedly the most accurate one, but it\u2019s not \nsuitable for widespread applications because the identification process takes too long, and \nrequires the usage of expensive equipment.\n\n\n\nwhitepaper | Biometric Identification 4\n\nWhen we look at finger vein recognition, it\u2019s worth noting that finger veins are the tiny \nblood vessels inside your finger, and are laid out in a pattern which is unique to every \nindividual. Finger vein based identity authentication systems might soon surge ahead \nbased on the unique advantages they offer. Even though finger vein identification may be \nless accurate than DNA profiling, it still possesses other highly competitive features, such \nas a shorter identification time, and usage of user-friendly and inexpensive equipment.\n\nRetina and iris scans are almost as accurate as DNA profiling but people are uncomfortable \nwith this approach because they feel it\u2019s too intrusive. The point being that every biometric \nidentification method comfortably finds its own application area.\n\nHere is a list of key requirements that biometric methods must satisfy in order to be \nsuccessful:\n\n\u2022 Uniqueness: biometric feature must be unique for every person\n\n\u2022 Permanence: should not change with time\n\n\u2022 Anti-forgery: difficult to falsify\n\n\u2022 Enrollment time: as minimal as possible\n\n\u2022 Identification time: as minimal as possible\n\n\u2022 Accepted by a user: should be user-friendly\n\nAmong these requirements, the first two, uniqueness and permanence, are probably the \nmost important ones because they both must be intrinsically unique when it comes to \nbiometric data, and the equipment must be able to permanently detect this uniqueness. \n\nThe same principle applies to the permanence feature. The only difference being that \nfor this feature to be applied successfully, the measuring equipment must permanently \nproduce a quality output as well, which is a serious requirement and isn\u2019t always met. For \nexample, certain noises can influence ECG measurements, while different light conditions \nmay provide a negative impact on the quality of the appearance of finger veins. These are \nminor but important issues which must be taken into account when developing biometric \ndevices.\n\nPreventing Forgery\n\nFor any biometric method to be successful, it must be difficult to forge. There has to \nbe an ability to pick-up, detect, store, and reproduce any stolen biometric data so that \nit can be tracked down and prevented from happening again. While fingerprint images \nare easy to forge, finger vein recognition is challenging because it\u2019s not easy to pick up a \nfinger vein image as it is easy to pick up a fingerprint. In any case, a compromise between \nkey requirements of a biometric method determines its place, role, and success on the \nbiometric methods field.\n\n\n\nwhitepaper | Biometric Identification 5\n\nEnrollment and Identification Time\n\nEnrollment time is the time needed to take and enter a person\u2019s data into a database, and \nthe identification time is the time it takes to acquire and to compare an actual person\u2019s \ndata with the one stored in a system\u2019s database.\n\nBoth enrollment and identification times differ for various biometrics\u2014they are very short \nfor fingerprint, finger vein, and face recognition, while longer for DNA profiling. Generally, \nthe shorter this time span, the better it is.\n\nAlong with the enrollment and identification time, biometric method acceptance by a user \nis the other criterion determining a method\u2019s success. Most characteristic methods from \nthe list provided in Table 1 have a rather high user acceptance rate, except for the iris and \nretina scans. Ultimately, the success of any specific biometric authentication system is \ndetermined by a goal to achieve and by a field of application as well.\n\nFINGER VEIN RECOGNITION\nFinger vein recognition is the latest and most reliable biometric method. This \nauthentication system works by using the vein patterns in an individual\u2019s fingers to verify \ntheir identity. When an individual\u2019s finger is placed on the vein recognition device, the vein \npatterns are scanned and recorded onto, and then they are matched with the records in a \ndatabase to confirm the identity of that individual.\n\nAs we have already seen, the performance of biometric methods is evaluated by a set \nof key factors. Here are some reasons why finger vein recognition is good for biometric \nidentification:\n\n\u2022 Uniqueness: research shows that finger vein patterns are unique for every person\n\n\u2022 Permanence: research shows that the human finger vein pattern is very stable over \nthe years. The only factor threatening this is if there is a finger injury. However, multiple \nfingers can be used for enrollment and identification.\n\n\u2022 Anti-forgery: veins are hidden in the human body, so it makes it extremely difficult to \nforge a finger vein\n\n\u2022 Enrollment time: around 30 seconds\n\n\u2022 Identification time: only a couple of seconds\n\nUnlike fingerprinting, where the biological information being scanned is on the outside of \nthe body, finger vein recognition scans information on inside of the body and therefore \nmakes forgery extremely difficult. Finger vein recognition thus serves as a highly secure \n\n\n\nwhitepaper | Biometric Identification 6\n\nform of personal recognition.\n\nThis point alone makes it a credible point of why finger vein recognition is becoming \npopular as a reliable and a user-friendly biometric recognition method.\n\nApproach\n\nThe main idea behind finger vein recognition technology lies in the fact that hemoglobin in \nthe blood vessels intensively absorbs electromagnetic radiation in the range around 750-\n1000nm, known as the near-infrared radiation (NIR), while the finger tissue and bones do \nnot.\n\nA clear image of the veins can be seen by placing an infrared camera on one side of the \nfinger, which is illuminated by the NIR source. When the image is acquired, it is then pre-\nprocessed by the correspondent algorithms to extract only the area of the finger (i.e. the \nso-called Region of interest, or else known as the ROI).\n\nAfter that feature, extraction algorithms are applied to obtain feature values specific for a \nfinger. Such sets of feature values for a person\u2019s fingers are stored in a database. Finally, \nto identify a person, the obtained finger vein image is matched with those stored in the \ndatabase and eventually a final decision is made on the identity of the individual. The \nprocess for carrying out finger vein recognition is shown below in Figure 1.\n\nFigure 1: A typical process for carrying out finger vein recognition\n\nImage \nacquisition\n\nPre-\nprocessing\n\nFeature \nextraction\n\nMatching Decision \nmaking\n\nState-of-the-Art Technology\n\nImaging techniques\n\nThere are a couple of finger vein imaging techniques:\n\nOne of them uses different Near-Infrared Lights (i.e. LEDs) as a light source, and positions \nthe infrared sensor camera (known as a CCD Camera) in various angles pointed towards \nthe finger. The LED and the CCD Camera should be placed on both sides of the finger, and \nin this case the veins can detected by the transmitted light. Please see Figure 2b. \n\nWith the other technique, an image can be taken in a reflected light when the LED source, \nwith the camera located on the same side with respect to a finger (please see Figure 2a). \nThe latter approach makes installation more compact, though the quality of the image is \nnormally lower compared to that taken in a transmitted light.\n\n\n\nwhitepaper | Biometric Identification 7\n\nIMAGE SENSOR\n(CCD CAMERA)\n\nIMAGE SENSOR\n(CCD CAMERA)\n\nNEAR-INFRARED LIGHT (LED)\n\nNEAR-INFRARED LIGHT (LED)\n\nVEIN VEIN\n\nFigure 2: Finger vein image taken in a) reflected light, b) transmitted light\n\nA B\n\nIdentification algorithms\n\nThere are quite a number of advanced finger vein recognition algorithms. There are some \ngreat insights on the subject in the \u201cA survey of finger vein recognition\u201d report by the team \nat the School of Computer Science and Technology at Shandong University.[2]\n\nGlobally, these algorithms can be divided into three classes:\n\n\u2022 Works with images taken from local data. This is the Local Binary Pattern (LBP) method \nand there are a number of its modifications that represent this class\n\n\u2022 Works with an image as a whole and operates on the image\u2019s integral characteristics. \nAlgorithms based on the Radon transform, wavelet transform, min/max curvature \nbelong to this class\n\n\u2022 Combines both the local and the integral approaches, and usually achieves better \nresults\n\nIn recent years, more powerful machine learning algorithms, including neural networks, \nhave also become key players in the field. Rapidly growing literature on the subject can be \nfound in this paper published by the IEEE.[1]\n\nIndustrial solutions\n\nThere are a number of industrial systems on the market using finger vein recognition as an \nidentification method. For example, industrial biometric security solutions developed by \nHitachi and Fujitsu provide finger vein recognition technology that is used in the following \napplications:\n\nhttps://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/9467/36a50457c790ddcf89bfc80dfe4bedb8141d.pdf\nhttps://ieeexplore.ieee.org/search/searchresult.jsp?reload=true&newsearch=true&queryText=finger%20vein%20authentication\n\n\nwhitepaper | Biometric Identification 8\n\n\u2022 Logical access applications\n\n\u2022 Applications for physical access through finger vein recognition systems\n\n\u2022 Vein pattern applications for ATM & banking\n\n\u2022 Embedded applications\n\nDespite a number of ready industrial solutions on the market, our primary goal was to \ndevelop a simple and an inexpensive hardware solution that gives a true \u201cfeeling\u201d of the \nsubject.\n\nOur methodology\n\nHardware setup\n\nFigure 3 below shows a picture of a finger vein recognition setup. The bottom part of the \ndevice contains LED sources illuminating the finger from beneath. Infrared light from four \n840 nm LEDs goes through the finger and is partially absorbed by finger veins caught by \nthe infrared camera on the top. There is also a circuitry used in this device setup. The black \nbox that contains the device is printed using our 3D printer.\n\nFigure 3: Finger vein image taking setup\n\nAn inexpensive infrared CCD camera was used \nin our setup, along with an infrared filter and a \n\u201cfish-eye\u201d optic lens. The light was provided by \n840nm LEDs. During the development of the \ndevice, the following important observations \nwere made: \n\n1. The intensity of the LEDs must be controlled \nso that it achieves the same brightness when  \nwe apply different parameters, such as if the \nthickness of the finger and its shape etc.\n\n2. Better finger images are obtained if the LED \nlightens up the finger from above. In the device \nshown in Figure 3, the fingers are still lightened \nup from beneath.\n\nIn Figure 4 below, raw images of two different \nfingers are shown. We can see that the quality \nof the images is good and quite sufficient for \ncarrying out a successful finger vein recognition.\n\n\n\nwhitepaper | Biometric Identification 9\n\nYou can clearly see the network of veins. However, the main challenge is that our camera \ndoesn\u2019t always generate high-quality images. Sometimes the images are either too bright \nor too dark, or sometimes they are just of an unacceptable quality. In any case, the camera \ncannot be controlled. This means that we should always use a camera of a high quality.\n\nFigure 4: Raw images of different fingers\n\nIn Figure 5 images of different fingers after pre-processing are shown. The pre-processing \nstage includes:\n\n\u2022 Gray normalization (equalizing) of the image\n\n\u2022 Extracting the region of interest (ROI)\n\n\u2022 Image resizing to end up with a reasonable final image size  \n(in our case it is 30x80 pixels)\n\nIt can be observed that pre-processed images are still of a high-quality because the veins \nare clearly visible.\n\nFigure 5: Pre-processed images of different fingers\n\n\n\nwhitepaper | Biometric Identification 10\n\nPBBM and OpenCV C++\n\nAs briefly stated above, algorithms used in finger vein recognition are roughly classified as \nthose that are analyzing local image features, integral features, or both. Local methods are \ngood for initial analysis; however, technologically, high reliability can only be achieved with \nthe methods that rely on local and integral approaches.\n\nPBBM\n\nAfter a number of experiments we made the decision to use a personalized best bit map \n(PBBM, see [3]) with some modifications.\n\nThe PBBM method partially addresses one of the key problems related to taking the \ncorrect photo of the finger, and how it differs considerably and can affect the end result. If \nthe image of the finger is not exactly the same as in reality, then this eventually lowers the \nidentification rates. \n\nOpenCV C++\n\nIn time, we also developed a customized OpenCV C++ application implementing the full \ncycle of finger vein recognition. It starts by taking an image using a camera, followed by \npre-processing, and eventually running through a trained model and making the final \ndecision on the recognition of the finger vein. The application also allows a person\u2019s \nidentification to be enrolled and stored. \n\nThe application was tested on a group of 12 people. Before the enrollment, the each \nperson was asked to place their forefinger on the device. After an expected unsuccessful \nlogin, the individual was successfully enrolled. The enrollment included taking four images \nof the finger and lasted 20-30 seconds. After that, the person was asked to login into the \nsystem again. \n\nIt must be said that not many tests have been carried out so far.\n\nHowever, the preliminary results are optimistic: there were a total of more than 200 \nattempts made by people to log in using their finger, by both enrolled and non-enrolled \npeople. \n\nIn around 95% of the cases, the system reacted correctly. That is to say that access was \ngranted for enrolled people and denied for those who were not enrolled. \n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3304137/\n\n\nwhitepaper | Biometric Identification 11\n\nWe achieved a False Acceptance Rate (FAR) of 1% and a False Recognition Rate (FRR) of 5%. \nIt should be noted that this was our first attempt, and because of this, there are areas in \nwhich we can improve. Namely in:\n\n1. Hardware: consider having a high-quality camera that can take clear  \nhigh-resolution images\n\n2. Software: we can combine local and integral algorithms\n\nConclusion\n\nThough a number of finger vein recognition devices are available on the market, in a rather \nshort time we have developed a customized and inexpensive solution from scratch that \nproduces good results. We also proposed some modifications to the existing algorithms \nthat improved the identification rate. This proves that even with a limited time and \nresources we can develop a competitive customized solution.\n\nBIOIMPEDANCE ANALYSIS\nIn general, the human body is able to conduct electric current and electromagnetic waves. \nAn individual\u2019s reaction to this, that is to say a human body\u2019s resistance to electric current \ndepends on individuals as everyone is different. If we are able to detect the difference in \nthis resistance, we\u2019re potentially able to determine a person by their individual electric \nresponse.\n\nThis is where the Bioelectrical Impedance Analysis (BIA) technique, or sometimes known as \nthe Bioimpedance Analysis, is used to estimate the body\u2019s composition. With BIA you can \nget a quick overview of the water and fat percentage in a body. Apart from being quick it is \na safe technique and one that's become very popular to its ease of use.\n\nThe key reason why we paid attention to BIA is because it looked possible to implement it \nas an example of the so-called \u2018edge computing\u2019 when data was aquired.\n\nLet\u2019s consider how BIA satisfies the key requirements of biometrics:\n\n\u2022 Uniqueness: investigation shows that an individual\u2019s bioimpedance is not as unique  \nas most other biometric characteristics\n\n\u2022 Permanence: it\u2019s been research and proven that an individual\u2019s bioimpedance is not \nquite stable over time. It can change during the day and depends on what they eat  \nand drink.\n\n\u2022 Anti-forgery: it\u2019s quite difficult to forge any bioimpedance data since picking it up is \nquite an arduous task\n\n\n\nwhitepaper | Biometric Identification 12\n\n\u2022 Enrollment time: 3-5 minutes\n\n\u2022 Identification time: a couple of seconds\n\n\u2022 User acceptance: high\n\nApproach\n\nPractical BIA consists of sending short electric pulses within a certain frequency range \nto a human body and measuring the response (i.e. the bioimpedance). The response \nis measured as a function of the specific tissue type (i.e. blood, muscle, bone, etc.) and \nits state, as well as anatomic configuration, which is determined by the orientation and \nquantity of the bone and tissues.\n\nTo cover the wider response area and thus increase the ability, the pulses are usually \ngenerated at a frequency range within 10-10000Hz. Then things such as the dissimilarities \nin bone structure, muscle density, fat content and the layout of blood vessels are expected \nto result in slight differences in the signals becoming weak at different frequencies This \nmakes it possible to identify an individual.\n\nThen the response at each frequency is subjected to the percentage of Fat-Free Mass (FFT), \nas well as active and reactive resistances (forming together a bioimpedance) are eventually \ncalculated. If 50 different frequencies are chosen, then 100 samples (50 samples of active \nresistance and 50 samples of reactive resistance) make up a raw bioimpedance signal.\n\nFrom the raw signal, a set of the selected features (usually up to ten) are extracted. \nFeatures are then inserted into a training model to determine the characteristic values for \nthe certain individual. The decision to finally identify is made by matching the actual values \nduring the identification session with those that are stored in the trained model.\n\nState-of-the-Art Technology\n\nBIA is mostly used in medicine for body composition measurements and healthcare \nassessment systems, and in particular for disease prognosis and the monitoring of vital \nstatus of a body.[4]\n\nThere are three types of BIA:\n\nSingle Frequency\u2013pulse of a single selected frequency is used\n\nMultiple frequency\u2013pulses of a number of different frequencies are applied\n\nBioimpedance spectroscopy\u2013deals with a broad range of frequencies\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3304137/\n\n\nwhitepaper | Biometric Identification 13\n\nAn individual\u2019s distinguishing ability is expected to be larger in the third case but the cost \nof the corresponding equipment is definitely higher. Choice of one of above BIA variations \ndepends on the objectives of the specific case.\n\nCurrently a number of BIA devices are developed for medical purposes. They usually use \nmany electrodes applied onto different parts of a body. Lately, body-area networks of \nwearable devices are becoming increasingly popular, especially in the healthcare, and \nentertainment industries.\n\nThese devices are able to discover each other, recognizing that they are on the same \nperson, and are able to establish a communication channel. But the most important thing \nabout BIA is that it must recognize a wearer.\n\nThere are a couple of solutions applying BIA in wearable devices (see sources [6] and [7]). \nOne of them deals with a wrist device that has twelve electrodes embedded in it. The main \npart of the device is the impedance analyzer chip. The data collected from the electrodes \nis processed by the chip, and then \u201craw\u201d bioimpedance samples are received as an output. \nA feature vector is extracted from the received raw data. Known classifiers, such as Naive \nBayes, and the Support Vector Machine are eventually used for identification.\n\nTo sum up, it can be stated that using BIA in wearable or otherwise embedded devices is \nstill in its infancy and the research carried out in this field is relevant.\n\nOur research\n\nWe developed a hardware solution that consisted of having a STM32L476 ultra-low-\npower microcontroller (MCU) and an AD5933 impedance analyzer. Our goal was to have \na small-sized hardware solution, preferably the size of a payment credit card. After a few \niterations, we came up with an agreed design.\n\nFigure 6: Credit card size device implementing full cycle of BIA\n\nhttps://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/files/8503/pulsekey-wpes-ccs.pdf\nhttp://sharps.org/wp-content/uploads/CORNELIUS-MOBISYS14.pdf\n\n\nwhitepaper | Biometric Identification 14\n\nDue to the limited size of the card, it was fitted with only two electrodes. To start the \nbioimpedance data acquisition session, we attached one finger of each hand to the each \nof the electrodes on the card. The card detected the fingers and started to collect data. \nThe impedance analyzer generated short pulses on 20 different frequencies in the range \nof 2-3 kHz and then analyzed the response. It applied a FFT analysis to respond to each \nfrequency and eventually calculated the bioimpedance on the specific frequency.\n\nThe total response consisted of 20 active resistance samples and 20 reactive resistance \nsamples. Hence, forming a raw biometric signal. Afterwards this data was sent to the MCU \nto be processed.\n\nFigure 7: Impedance for different persons\n\n24000\n2.0 2.2 2.4 2.6 2.8\n\n25000\n\n26000\n\n27000\n\n28000\n\n29000\n\n30000\n\nFrequency, kHz\n\nIm\npe\n\nda\nnc\n\ne,\n O\n\nhm\ns\n\nCustom firmware running on a MCU was developed. It extracted the feature vector from \nthe received raw bioimpedance signal, which were calculated for each frequency. In our \ncase, the feature vector consisted of five components, namely minimum and maximum \nvalues of raw signal, signal power, and the kurtosis and the skewness.\n\n\n\nwhitepaper | Biometric Identification 15\n\n0 5010 20 30 40\nSample\n\nFigure 8: Features distribution\n\nThe training stage, which was carried out on PC to offload calculation from the card, \nincluded several sessions that collected sufficient raw bioimpedance data for each person. \nWhen the training was complete, the training model parameters were transferred to the \ncard.\n\nDuring the identification stage the feature vector extracted from actual bioimpedance \nsignal runs through the classifier (the latter uses characteristics from the trained model) \nand eventually final decision is made. We tested several different classifiers, namely \nSupport Vector Machine, Simple Perceptron and Naive Bayes. The last one proved to be \nthe most effective.\n\nTests showed that the BIA is not as successful as finger vein recognition. The system \nreacted correctly in around 65% percent of the identification attempts. Effectively, access \nwas granted for people who were enrolled (i.e. people whose data was in our database), \nand denied for those who were not enrolled. For finger vein recognition we had this rate \nleveling at 95%.\n\nWe found out that for a group of five individuals whose bioimpedance sufficiently differs, \nthe BIA identification worked at an acceptable level. The larger the number of participants, \nthe lower the rate of correct identification.\n\n\n\nwhitepaper | Biometric Identification 16\n\nConclusion\n\nTwo important observations regarding BIA were noticed. Either the bioimpedance data is \nnot unique enough or the bioimpedance data is not stable enough.\n\nTherefore, we can say that BIA by itself cannot reliably distinguish persons (see, for \nexample [5]). It could be; however, used in a fusion of biometric solutions where BIA would \nplay a secondary role in identification of an individual.\n\nELECTROCARDIOGRAM\nThe human heart is a complex muscular organ that uses electricity for activating different \nmuscles. An electrocardiogram (ECG) is a recording of the electrical activity of the heart's \nrhythm. Sensors attached to the skin can be used to detect electrical signals produced by \nyour heart each time it beats. The structure of the heart differs for each individual and the \nability to distinguish ECG results for different people is limited by a lot of factors.\n\nLet\u2019s consider in more details how the ECG identification meets the principal requirements \nfor biometric identification methods:\n\n\u2022 Uniqueness: is not absolutely unique and has limited possibilities of precise \nmeasurement\n\n\u2022 Permanence: is not stable over years, and could be significantly influenced by changes \nin lifestyle \n\n\u2022 Anti-forgery: precise enough measurements could be done only with direct contact (or \nat least at a very short distance) during some period of time. Not easy to forge an ECG.\n\n\u2022 Enrollment time: dozens of minutes\n\n\u2022 Identification time: one heart beat (approx. 1 second), practically \u2013 dozens of seconds\n\nECG-based identification has the same advantages as vein recognition technology. \nEssentially, biometric data is not left imprinted on any device or everyday objects, and \nadditionally it is completely passive as no additional electricity is applied to the human \nbody.\n\nhttps://www.technologyreview.com/s/428755/biometric-bracelet-lets-a-medical-device-recognize-its-wearer/\n\n\nwhitepaper | Biometric Identification 17\n\nApproach\n\nThe basis of ECG identification is a QRS complex\u2013a name for the combination of three of \nthe graphical deflections seen on a typical ECG heartbeat. It is usually the central and most \nvisually obvious part of the chart. In other words, it's the main spike seen on an ECG line, \nas seen in Figure 9. It corresponds to the depolarization of the right and left ventricles of \nthe human heart and contraction of the large ventricular muscles. \n\nThe peaking of the R is not fixed because it purely depends on the heart rate, and the \nwaveform of the QRS complex itself is stable and could be used for identification.\n\nFigure 9. QRS complex\n\nP T\n\nR\n\nQ\nS\n\nQRS Complex\n\nPR Segment ST Segment\n\nPR Interval\n\nQT Interval\n\nTheoretically, one \u2018beat\u2019 (i.e. a waveform) could be used for identification. Practically, \nelectric noise is always present during the measurement stage (i.e. environmental noise, \nmuscle noise, and equipment noise). \n\nIt should be noted that several beats are needed for the recording of a reliable waveform. \nDifferent methods for noise reduction should also be explored, and these can use machine \nlearning [8] and other methods.\n\nThere are several methods that can be used for achieving a reliable and accurate \nidentification, including traditional classifiers and deep neural networks.\n\nhttps://github.com/softserveinc-rnd/ecg-denoise\n\n\nwhitepaper | Biometric Identification 18\n\nOur research\n\nWe chose a case where it\u2019s possible to measure the body\u2019s ECG signal in an interesting \nway \u2013 by using a car driver\u2019s fingers, as shown in Photo 1 below. As a result, it was possible \nto identify a driver, which was the second factor together with having a key, and we \ncontinuously monitored the driver\u2019s presence to avoid a substitution. \n\nWe developed a prototype (Biolock) where the ECG was captured by electrodes embedded \ninto the steering wheel. As an added advantage, no additional interaction with the user \nwas required.\n\nPhoto 1: How we measured the ECG using a biolock in a steering wheel\n\n\n\nwhitepaper | Biometric Identification 19\n\nBMD101 Recording\n\nAccept  \nor reject\n\nPeak \ndetection\n\nMerge by \nwindow\n\nSegmen- \ntation\n\nClassifi- \ncation\n\nWHEEL PHONE CLOUD\n\nFigure 10: Biolock pipeline\n\nThe Biolock pipeline process is seen in Figure 10 below:\n\nA measured signal was streamed via Bluetooth to a mobile phone, where the application \nran. The application collected the ECG in a 15-second buffer and sent data to the cloud for \nprocessing and recognition.\n\nFirstly, R-peaks were detected using the Pan Tompkins algorithm. Then, the recorded signal \nwas split on separate QRS-complexes (neighbor of R-peak, as shown on Figure 7). The \nextracted complexes were merged into one by averaging in order to reduce noise levels \nand artifacts.\n\nAfter normalization was applied, we obtained QRS complex and passed to the neural \nnetwork for training (enrollment stage) or for the prediction (verification stage).\n\nAs a result, we managed to satisfy two of our main criterias: the recognition time was less \nthan 30 seconds and the accuracy was higher than 90% for a group of 20 people.\n\nOur Biolock demo was one of the finalists at SXSW 2017 [9] in the \u201cSmart City\u201d category.\n\nConclusions\n\nECG identification has similar problems to Bioimpedance identification because:\n\n\u2022 it is not unique in a certain way. Why? For example: if we have two people doing the \nsame activity (e.g. running or hiking), for a long period of time (i.e. many years!), then \ntheir heart\u2019s behaviors would become similar.\n\n\u2022 it changes with time\n\nhttps://www.sxsw.com/interactive/2017/interactive-innovation-awards-65-finalists/\n\n\nwhitepaper | Biometric Identification 20\n\nNevertheless, ECG identification works great in cases of continuous monitoring of an \nindividual\u2019s  presence.\n\nAdditionally, ECG could be measured without the need of sensors to be applied directly to \nthe skin. So, the sensors can be placed on clothes or have them integrated into a car seat \n(\u201csmart seating\u201d) etc.\n\nSummary\n\nIt goes without saying that at the moment, there is not one single biometric identification \nmethod that allows the accurate identification of any individual. Each use case requires a \nthorough research on what method is the most appropriate in any specific conditions and \nlimitations.\n\nTo improve the identification performance, so that we get accurate results, it requires a \ncombination of neat blend of different methods (i.e. maybe two or three factor biometric \nidentification methods) that can predict behaviors or possibilities to identify a user at any \nparticular moment in time.\n\nWe believe that biometric identification will be a fundamental part of measuring all \naspects of security in the future, with new  and wider possibilities to recognize and feel the \nemotional state of individuals.\n\nHence, we also believe that the technologies will easily adapt to a specific individual\u2019s \nneeds, even to the extent that they won\u2019t require any mediation. This all forms an \nimportant part of the \u201cAmbient Intelligence\u201d vision of the future.\n\nReferences\n \n\n1. Finger vein on IEEE\n2. Survey on finger vein recognition\n3.

Unfortu-\n\nnately, it is not uncommon for internal stake-\nholders to grow accustomed to the common \nframework. Also, similar mindsets lead to a lim-\nited number of perspectives. Fortunately, ample \ntalent exists for external talent and ideation \ninfusion. The key to successful external talent \nintegration is to properly harnass said strengths \nand abilities.\n\n\n\nwhitepaper Crowdsourcing: A Path to Talent Optimization 3\n\nDEFINING \n\u201cCROWDSOURCING\u201d\n\nThe brainstorming process is a long proven \nway to generate ideas. This process even-\n\ntually gave rise to the phenomenon known \nas crowdsourcing\u2014the pairing of crowds and \noutsourcing. The term itself was coined in \n2006 by Jeff Howe in his article \u2018The Rise of \nCrowdsourcing\u2019 and it did not take long for \n\u2018crowdsourcing\u2019 to become a buzz word across \nindustries.\n\nTechopedia defines crowdsourcing as an \noutsourcing, problem-solving technique \nthat involves collaboration of different \npeople who are supposed to accomplish a \nspecific task. The participants (aka crowd-\nsourcers) act as subject matter experts \n(SMEs) and often may be located in geo-\ngraphically distant places. The work is usu-\nally done remotely via an online platform \nand financial compensation is awarded after \nthe completion of a task.\n\nAPPLYING \nCROWDSOURCING\nTo successfully deliver human-centric solu-\ntions and products, companies must lever-\nage a team of talent that is driven by human-\nistic, value stream design thinking. One of \nthe primary benefits of crowdsourcing is the \nability to employ the collective intelligence \nof cross-matrix thought leaders who are \ndriven by shared vision, goals, and passion.\n\nCrowdsourcing is used to generate ideas \nfor brands and enterprises, but its applica-\ntions have expanded and the list of success \nstories is continuously growing. High pro-\nfile examples of successful crowdsourcing \ninclude Wikipedia, Kickstarter, and AirBnB \nto name a few. Global brands like Amazon, \nLEGO, and Unilever are having great success \nwith crowdsourcing as well.\n\n\n\nwhitepaper Crowdsourcing: A Path to Talent Optimization 4\n\nBENEFITS OF \nCROWDSOURCING\n\nT here are numerous benefits to crowdsourc-\ning including:\n\n\u2022 Ground-breaking ideas\n\u2022 Solving complex problems\n\u2022 Finding new models\n\u2022 Enhancing efficiency and innovation\n\u2022 Encouraging out-of-the-box thinking \n\nAdditionally, crowdsourcing improves scale, \ndiversity, and intrinsic motivation\u2014in the \nform of learning, competition, and commu-\nnity recognition\u2014vs only typical incentives \n(such as salary and bonuses). In other words, \ncrowdsourcing delivers you 5Ps: people, pur-\npose, participation, platform, and produc-\ntivity that deliver significant improvements.\n\nCHALLENGES WITH \nCROWDSOURCING\nIt would be imprudent to highlight the ben-\nefits of crowdsourcing without addressing \nthe inherent challenges that companies may \nface when leveraging outside talent and \nideas. Crowdsourcing delivers large volumes \nof information that is often difficult to man-\nage. If solutions are misaligned with stan-\ndard corporate operating procedures\u2014or \nwhen too costly\u2014implementation is espe-\ncially challenging.\n\nThe greatest obstacle to crowdsourcing adop-\ntion is intellectual property. Sharing insider \ninformation with outside parties\u2014even with \nNDA in place\u2014is not something to take lightly. \nBefore adopting crowdsourcing, companies \nmust understand how to mitigate risks.\n\nSAFEGUARDING WITH \nCROWDSOURCING\nThere are three questions that companies \nmust consider when choosing the right \ncrowdsourcing platform:\n\n1. Does the crowdsourced platform vet \nits crowd? \n\n2. Is the crowd available 24/7?\n3. How much control is there over \n\ntransparency? \n\nAnswering these simple questions will pro-\nvide contextual pros and cons to empower \nthe company to choose the right crowd-\nsourcing vendor.\n\nIf a company feels it could benefit from an \ninfusion of external creativity and innova-\ntion\u2014SoftServe offers two viable solutions: \nIdeation Workshops and Business Innova-\ntion Hackathons.\n\n\n\nwhitepaper Crowdsourcing: A Path to Talent Optimization 5\n\nTHE SOFTSERVE WAY\n\nAt SoftServe, we bring a human-centric, \ndesign thinking approach to crowdsourc-\n\ning. Our innovation platform is an end-to-end \nmanagement tool that helps to deliver innova-\ntion within an enterprise. We empower clients to \nconvert futureproof ideas into executable proj-\nects.\n\nThe Innovation Platform consist of three \nmodules:\n\nIdeate phase: sets the framework to create, \ncollect, discuss, and prioritize ideas using \ncrowdsourcing power with the possibility \nto invite customers as well as internal and \nexternal partners\n\nIterate phase: helps to shape and market \nyour ideas as you collect and analyze feed-\nback in preparation for implementation.\n\nDeliver phase: a well-planned implementa-\ntion process using OKRs framework to track \nand measure the effectiveness of your inno-\nvation\n\n\n\nwhitepaper Crowdsourcing: A Path to Talent Optimization 6\n\nSOFTSERVE DIFFERENTIATORS\n\nSecurity and privacy are among our Inno-\nvation Platform\u2019s key market differen-\n\ntiators as a result of our holistic, layered \napproach to security\u2014aligned with best \npractices of data processing.

Hackathon \nsuccess is due to our four-stage process: \npreparation, workshop, ideas presentation, \nand proof of concept development\n\nPREPARATION \nDuring this stage, the challenge is assessed by \ndefining the goals and problems on the basis of \ninterviews with key stakeholders. Preparation \nmay last 1 to 14 days depending on the com-\nplexity of the issue to be solved, location, and \nteams distribution around the globe. It is very \nimportant to engage right people from the very \nbeginning as this lays foundation and shapes \ncontext for the next steps.   \n\nWORKSHOP\n\nNext, the challenge is created in the Innovation \nPlatform and the true ideation process starts. \nIn this stage, teams engage in researching and \nbrainstorming under the guidance of a profes-\nsional facilitator. Empowered by visibility pro-\nvided by our Innovation Platform, the client can \nview all the ideas and provide feedback that \nsets the direction for the various teams.\n\nPREPARATION\n\n\u2022 Define goals and problems\n\u2022 Assess challenges\n\u2022 Interview key stakeholders\n\nWORKSHOP\n\u2022 Create challenges based on gaps\n\u2022 Ideate on Innovation platform\n\u2022 Vote and prioritize best ideas\n\nIDEAS PRESENTATION\n\u2022 Vote for the best idea per team\n\u2022 Create elevator pitch and presenta-\n\ntion\n\nDEVELOP PROOFS OF \nCONCEPT\n\u2022 Prototyping\n\u2022 PoC\n\u2022 Project plan\n\u2022 Implementation roadmap\n\n\n\nwhitepaper Crowdsourcing: A Path to Talent Optimization 8\n\nIDEAS PRESENTATION\nAfterwards, teams vote for the best idea \nand present their pitch to the jury who then \nchoses the winner.

This comprehensive \napproach enables our client to validate ideas \nbefore investing in full-cycle implementa-\ntion\u2014ensuring a viable product that truly \nsolves the problem at hand and meets the \nstated business needs.\n\nThis four step process delivers: new \nproduct ideas, justified business \nsolutions, a clear business model, \nvision, and roadmap. Also, our pro-\ncess alleviates client concerns over \ntechnical issues, freeing companies \nto focus on daily business while we \nwork on an innovative and bespoke \nproduct.\n\nNEXT STEPS\nAny enterprise company that isn\u2019t already \nleveraging external talent and insights is at \na competitive disadvantage to those brands \nthat do.

But today, \ncompanies are increasingly embracing an \nomnichannel sales strategy and Semafone \nwas receiving regular requests from its \nbusiness customers looking for a secure \ndigital payment platform to service non-voice \ntransactions. They needed to implement a new \ncloud agnostic architecture quickly (in under 3 \nmonths) and it needed to be secure, compliant \nwith PCI DSS and other regulatory standards \nand include a dedicated support team.\n\nAs a PCI DSS Level 1 service provider, Semafone \nmust ensure that card holder data and \npersonally identifiable information (PII) is \nsecured and that encryption is properly \nimplemented. The new platform needed \nto enhance the security of applications to \nmitigate recent vulnerabilities and threats, \nreduce both costs & time, and adhere to the \nlatest PCI DSS requirements.\n\nProject Description\n\nSoftServe developed a web-based service \nfor payment processing that was built \nfrom scratch from detailed Semafone \n\nrequirements.  Cardprotect Relay+ enables \nmerchants to generate secure links that \nthey can send to their customers who then \nenter their payment details into a secure \nweb form, whilst receiving real-time updates \nthroughout the customer process.\n\nThe AWS hosted solution is integrated with \ndifferent payment services providers (PSPs) \nusing Semafone created PSP integrations. \nThe AWS infrastructure was built starting \nfrom a prepared Landing Zone, designed \nand delivered by the SoftServe DevOps \nand DevSecOps teams.

But the most successful projects are led by experts from the \noutset. Whether you need a software expert or a project management expert, they can focus \nall their skills on your goals \u2014 delivering to your individual requirements cost-effectively, \nefficiently, and without any of the day-to-day time commitment of doing it yourself.\n\nThere are four key elements to look for when selecting a partner: talent, history, speed,  \nand support.\n\nIn this white paper, we\u2019ll examine each of these in more detail to explain why they are \nimportant individually, and how together this quad creates a formidable formula.\n\n2whitepaper | Go Faster: Efficient Software Development\n\nTALENT\n\nDevelopment projects by their very nature \nrequire interaction with pre-existing \nsystems, and an understanding of your \nbusiness. Navigating these is a task that \n\nfull development lifestyle and stack.\n\nSUPPORT\n\nTalent, history, and speed combine to \ncreate a strong safety net of support for \nwhatever comes your way.\n\nSPEED\n\nHISTORY\n\nBut if done too fast and without agility, your \nROI can quickly be minimized. Technology \nexperts with industry knowledge know how \nbest to diagnose your challenges and deal \nwith them rapidly. \n\nGiven the pace and acceleration of \ntechnology and coding practice, experience \nis an invaluable asset, culminating in the \nskill-set your team will bring.\n\n\n\nPartner with a Talented Team\nIn any industry, talent defines the strength of your success. In software development in \nparticular, a range of talent is essential if projects are to be completed in a time- and cost-\neffective manner.\n\nTalent is not only defined by technological skills, but also by the ability of an external team to \nseamlessly integrate into your existing team to work effectively.\n\nAt SoftServe, we have more than 500 of the best software engineers in the industry. Whether \nit\u2019s big data, IoT, cloud, DevOps, digital commerce, security or experience design, our experts \nhave the knowledge to help with any software development project.\n\nFor example, SoftServe equipped ContractPal, a SaaS business process outsourcing \ncompany, with better confidence in its security posture, using our unique approach to \nsecurity testing. ContractPal required proof of regular code review and security audits, with a \nspecific requirement for manual ethical hacking by a third-party organization.\n\nSoftServe met this specific testing need, with a special team of Certified Ethical Hackers who \ncompleted the testing in just two weeks. Our Certified Ethical Hackers showed ContractPal \nexactly where regular hackers would exploit weaknesses in the event of a security breach, \nand provided manual penetration testing with the market\u2019s best security testing tools. The \ntesting process included dynamic application security testing, manual penetration testing, \nand application source code analysis using OWASP Application Security Verification Standard, \nOWASP Testing Guide, and Penetration Testing Execution Standard. \n\nHaving Certified Ethical Hackers is an invaluable talent to have for security testing, and it\u2019s \nexpertise like this that is important to seek in a software development partner.\n\n3whitepaper | Go Faster: Efficient Software Development\n\nhttps://www.softserveinc.com/en-us/our-work/manual-penetration-testing-contractpal/\n\n\nSoft Skills\nFor software development projects everywhere, a lack of communication can topple a project \nno matter how much technical expertise a collective in-house team has.\n\nYour team should have a variety of skills that concentrate on your technological solution, \nbut also have communication and soft skills. These traits are key especially for clients \nwho operate in more than one country, as cultural nuances and cross-border thinking \nis increasingly required. Ultimately the project\u2019s success rides not only on the talent and \nexpertise of the team, but their ability to work collaboratively with existing teams, likely \nacross the globe.\n\nSoft skills, such as proactivity, reliability, and authenticity are a less verbalized set of \ncompetences, but become paramount to a software development project\u2019s success.\n\nAt SoftServe, we focus on building effective communication with your team to enable a \nseamless connection from start to finish\u2013from concept to delivery\u2013for projects. These skills \nare essential to create the right working relationships and a positive, productive culture.\n\nDeveloping Talent\nA good software development company is constantly assessing its demands, and monitors \nthe market to define a pool of professional, experienced candidates with the right skills and \nwork history.\n\nSimilarly, these companies should also be constantly monitoring internal personnel to \nidentify high-potential employees to provide them with new, challenging tasks, leading them \nto new growth and career opportunities. At SoftServe, all of our employees go through a \nrigorous training program that helps them to develop the skills that they need for success.\n\nWe constantly monitor the market to identify candidates with specific \ntechnology skills and work histories, so you don\u2019t have to.\n\nAll employees undergo our own rigorous training at SoftServe University.

The business goal was to decom-\nmission the platform and migrate 400 TB of \ndata along with analytical processes to the \ncloud, while minimizing costs associated \nwith data storage and third party support, \nand enabling unlimited infrastructure \nscalability.\n\nProject Description\n\nOur client began its cloud migration to \nAWS with another vendor. However, due \nto this vendor\u2019s lack of AWS experience, \n\nour client struggled with infrastructure setup \nissues, crossed planned deadlines, and thus \nhad fallen far behind schedule.\n\nAWS reached out SoftServe to step in to \nthe project as an AWS ProServe to get the \nmigration project back on track, validate \nthe target AWS architecture provided by \nthe previous vendor, and help with issues \nresolution. SoftServe determined that one \nof the major technical requirements for \nthe AWS-based solution was mimicking the \nexisting Hortonworks Data Platform based \nTeradata Hadoop Appliance setup in terms \nof security, data analysis, and data explo-\nration tools.\n\nThe cluster needed to be secured and auditable, \nsupport Kerberos/ActiveDirectory integration \nwith SSO for end user interfaces, and support \nHive/HDFS/HBase/Yarn authorization via Apa- \nche Ranger, as well as fine-grained autho-\nrization for EMRFS. End users such as data \nscientists, data analyst, developers, and power  \nusers had to be able to use toolsets like \nSpark, Hive on LLAP, HBase/Phoenix, Sqoop, \nAutosys, Atlas, and Ranger on Amazon EMR. \n\ncase study |    AWS ProServe Hadoop Cloud Migration for \n     Property and Casualty Insurance Leader\n\n2\n\n\n\nCustomer Challenge\n\nT he data platform architecture, designed \nby the client, was based on a combination \nof customized Amazon EMR persis- \n\ntent and transient clusters with shared data \nstorage on EMRFS, as shown on Figure 1. \n\nOur client faced deployment and configu-\nration challenges while integrating Ranger, \nHive on LLAP, Atlas, and edge nodes with \nAmazon EMR and on-prem security systems,\n\nincluding EMRFS authorization configu-\nration. This kind of integration is not compli-\ncated, however it requires deep domain \nexpertise in big data, cloud, and security. \nThese integration challenges, in conjunction \nwith strict timelines, would jeopardize \nproject success, and thus our client made the \ndecision to involve the AWS ProServ team. \n\nAmazon\nCloudWatch\n\nVPC\n\nAWS Cloud\n\nSubnet A Subnet B\n\nHive\nMetastore\n\nAmazon\nDynamoDB\n\nHive/Spark\nTransient\n\nAWS\nCloudFormation\n\nAWS\nDirectConnect\n\nActive\nDirectory\n\nOn-premises\n\nHadoop Databases\n\nsh\nar\n\ned\n r\n\nes\nou\n\nrc\nes\n\nAtlas Server\n\nRanger\nServer\n\nEdge Nodes\n\nAmazon EMR\n\nPresistant\n\nEMRFS with Consistent view\nAuthH/AuthZ\n\nCluster A\nSpark\n\nCluster B\nHave LLAP\n\nAmazon\nS3\n\nIAM\n\nruns onjcbd/odbchttps/ssh https/ssh\n\nData Users Power Users\n\nScheduled\nELT/ETL\n\nBI UsersFigure 1.

More specifical-\n\nly, it needed to provide a unified platform \nbased on set of highly integrated, best of the \nbreed tools - Microsoft Office 365 and ZOOM. \nSoftServe\u2019s goal was to improve collaboration \nand communication within the company by \nshifting from the obsolete, insecure toolsets to \nmodern cloud-based suites. Without a wide-\nly accepted, and standardized toolset SoftS-\nerve faced challenges around collaboration \nbetween different business functions, which \nhad significant impacts due to the company\u2019s \nmatrix organizational structure.\n\nSoftServe was utilizing Skype for Business \nwhich didn\u2019t provide the expected quality, \nwas complicated to use, had poor UX/UI (es-\npecially for MacOS), and didn\u2019t support Linux. \nMicrosoft had also announced it intended to \ndiscontinue S4B in 2 years. Without a new \ntoolset implementation, SoftServe could not \nfully utilize the value from Office 365 due to \nlack of licenses, also known as \u2018gray\u2019 licensing \nand it could not effectively back up its massive \n\u00b110TB of project data in the cloud.\n\nDeploying a new set of collaboration and com-\nmunication platforms would improve custom-\ner satisfaction, unify employee experience \nby improving collaboration within teams and \nprojects, improve the efficiency of the hiring \nand onboarding process, and allow SoftServe \nto depreciate the Skype for Business service \ndue to product end-of-live.\n\nCompany Background\n\nS oftServe is a digital authority that ad-\nvises and provides at the cutting-edge \nof technology.

Electrical \nSubmersible Pumps (ESP) account for the \nlargest share of the artificial lift market \nand play a critical role in helping energy \ncompanies realize operational excellence. \n\nToday, reliance on manual methods \nfor ESP monitoring and optimization is \ntime-consuming, expensive, and prone to \nhuman error. But intelligent technologies \nsuch as Artificial Intelligence (AI), Machine \nLearning (ML), and Big Data can take \nthe complexity out of operating ESPs by \nhelping to identify opportunities, recognize \nproblems, and optimize production rates.\n\nAn energy industry client\u2019s \nsuccess story\n\nOur client, Vital Energy, is a leading \nenergy company that focuses \non the acquisition, exploration, \n\nand development of oil and natural gas \nproperties. Operational efficiency and \nproduction optimization are among the \nkey company\u2019s priorities. Currently, Vital \nEnergy is investing in digital technologies \nto ensure asset integrity, reduce operating \ncosts, and increase production rates.\n\nESP-operated wells play a strategic role \nin Vital Energy's digital transformation \nstrategy. New and in-service wells that \nrun on ESP need constant monitoring and \ntuning of operating parameters to achieve \nhigh efficiency and production targets. Vital \nEnergy wanted to create an AI-based solution \nfor ESP optimization that will automatically \nrecommend ESP operating parameters, give \nthe ability to visualize all the necessary data, \nand have a way to leave feedback, input \nlimitations, and operating constraints.\n\ncase study Boost oil production by optimizing operating parameters of ESP with AI 2\n\n\n\nOur approach\n\nSoftServe helped Vital Energy build a comprehensive solution on Amazon Web Services \n(AWS) using Deep Neural Network (DNN) algorithms and optimization techniques, \nincluding extensive visualization and interpretation for end users. It models the \n\nentire system by simulating telemetry and production with different scenarios. Also, it \nallows Vital Energy to find the best possible controls to meet constraints such as motor \ntemperature, voltage, intake pressure, and gas or water volume. The algorithm can be \nadapted to various ESP systems and provides operators with optimal daily control.\n\nSolution outcomes:\n\n\u2022 An ML model with high prediction accuracy of oil/gas/water production \ndetermined from data collected during several months from 50 ESPs\n\n\u2022 An automatically retrained pipeline deployed to the AWS environment\n\u2022 Interactive visualizations of simulation scenarios \n\u2022 Streamlit dashboard as a prototype platform for parameter recommendations testing\n\u2022 Combination of ML- and physical-based models\n\nAmazon Athena Amazon SageMaker Vendors Databases\n\nAmazon S3 T2 instance   PowerBI      User\n\nHistorical \nTelemetry\n\nControls\n\nHistorical \nProduction\n\nESP Stats\n\nTelemetry \nModel\n\nProduction \nModel\n\nPrediction \nof Future \nTelemetry\n\nPrediction \nof Future \n\nProduction\n\ncase study Boost oil production by optimizing operating parameters of ESP with AI 3\n\n\n\nLET\u2019S TALK about how SoftServe can help digitally transform your company processes and \neffectively scale your digital strategy to the next level. \n\nValue delivered\n\nSoftServe helped Vital Energy move to data-driven ESP optimization \nand achieve their business goals, including:\n\n\u2022 Real-time dashboards that provide summary statistics, forecasts, and parameter \nrecommendations for better decision-making\n\n\u2022 A highly flexible solution that can be adapted to a variety of ESP systems \n\u2022 Reduced downtime, better maintenance practices, and reduced OPEX \n\u2022 Our initial pilot was estimated to see additional ~400 BBL across 29 test wells\n\u2022 Scalability in months from 29 to more than 100 wells in production\n\u2022 High accuracy of prediction of oil/gas/water production\n\ncase study Boost oil production by optimizing operating parameters of ESP with AI 4\n\nhttps://www.softserveinc.com/en-us/contact\n\n\nABOUT SOFTSERVE\n\nWe are a digital authority made up of advisors, engineers, and designers \nwho deliver innovation, quality, and speed to elevate and accelerate our \nclients\u2019 digital journeys.\n\nOur approach is built on a foundation of empathetic, human-focused \nexperience design that ensures value and continuity from concept to \nrelease.\n\nWE IDENTIFY WHERE YOU ARE.                   \nWE PREPARE YOU FOR THE ROAD AHEAD.\u00a0 \nWE TAKE YOU WHERE YOU NEED TO GO.\u00a0\nVisit our website, blog, LinkedIn, Facebook, and Twitter pages.\n\nNORTH AMERICAN HQ\n\n201 W 5th Street, Suite 1550 \nAustin, TX 78701 \nUSA +1 866 687 3588 (USA)           \n+1 647 948 7638 (Canada) \n\nEUROPEAN HQ\n\n30 Cannon Street\nLondon EC4M 6XH\nUnited Kingdom  \n+44 333 006 4341\n\ninfo@softserveinc.com \nwww.softserveinc.com\n\n\n", "LocationURL": "https://www.softserveinc.com/files/cases/boost-oil-production-by-optimizing-operating-parameters-of-esp-with-ai.pdf", "id": "sw-rf-822", "FileName": "boost-oil-production-by-optimizing-operating-parameters-of-esp-with-ai.pdf", "Storage": "SoftServe Website", "Published": "2022-04-08T10:55:58Z", "FileType": ".pdf"}, {"Category": null, "content": "\nTHE NEED\nFOR SPEED\n\nA virtual care company partners \nwith SoftServe to quickly integrate \nacquired systems\n\nCase Study\n\n\n\nCase Study   |   The Need for Speed 2\n\nMerger and acquisition announcements are common, \nbut you don\u2019t hear about the post-acquisition integration \nheadaches.

In the summer of 2018 over 700 businesses in \nthe US and EU were probed with regard to how brands are adapting to the disruptive forces \nof the digital era, what business needs are driving change or disruption, what technologies \nare critical for the future, and more. \n\nToday\u2019s businesses\u2014whether small, medium, or enterprise\u2014are faced with a constant \nstream of disruptive forces, not least of which is the accelerated pace of the connected and \ntruly global digital economy. \n\nWell-known brands close down seemingly by the week; online banks and financial start-\nups challenge long-held norms in business. Multinational companies with 75+ years of \nsuccessful track records are increasingly put under pressure by venture-backed start-ups \nacross Silicon Valley and beyond. \n\nThose seeking to survive and thrive are right to seek out opportunities to be more digital. \nYet the landscape is incredibly complex and overwhelming\u2014peppered with vendors who \ntout the latest technologies and strategies, yet fail to deliver. \n\nTo make matters worse, managers are bombarded with broad-scale marketing and \nadvertising programs encouraging them to \u201cMove the Market with AI\u201d (Accenture 2017) \nor to leverage AI to assist in \u201cEmpowering Innovation\u201d (Microsoft 2018) or to partner with \na firm who will assist clients to \u201cBe Digital. Be More.\u201d (Infosys 2017). Instead of forming a \npoint of view on how these technologies can move the needle, corporate managers are left \nscratching their heads, with nothing more than catchy ad copy. \n\nPerhaps the most contentious of all of these modern marketing messages is \u201cDigital \nTransformation\u201d.\n\nDIGITAL\nTRANSFOR-\nMATION\n\nhttps://www.accenture.com/us-en/insight-artificial-intelligence-business-process\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tucY7Jhhs4\nhttps://www.slideshare.net/Infosys/be-digital-be-more\n\n\nwhitepaper | The Enterprise Digital Journey 3\n\nA digital identity crisis\n\n\u201cDigital Transformation\u201d has been in wide circulation since 1999, coined by Kevin Ashton of \nProcter & Gamble. And while the term seems quite fashionable and current\u2014it is not. \n\nThe term \u201cDigital Transformation\" is both ubiquitous and damaging. \n\nUbiquitous because no one seems to really understand what Digital Transformation means \nin itself, there is a never-ending conflation of definitions associated with the term and an \ninherent implication that \u201cTransformation\u201d is a one-off event for those who undergo it. \n\nDamaging because leading consulting firms refuse to articulate what is needed for success \nin today\u2019s digital economy. This causes inaction on the part of corporate managers, \nultimately rendering those businesses obsolete as the speed of digital accelerates.\n\nAt no point does a firm\u2019s claim to be \u201c100% digital\u201d translate into understanding true \nbusiness pain points or concerns for clients. Even consulting firms are overreaching on \nmarketing messages that trumpet technological advancement, rather than solving the real \nbusiness problems of the digital economy.\n\nThis paper argues that consulting firms are failing enterprises as companies make the \nleap into the digital economy of the 21st century. Rather, digital firms will only be able to \nsuccessfully advise clients on the way forward through a comprehensive understanding of \nenterprise market forces and challenges.\n\nFurther, it is no longer good practice for firms to either advise or provide solutions for \nclients\u2014they must do both. Firms that design, develop, and deliver clients\u2019 business \noutcomes will see the greatest degrees of success in the short-, medium-, and long-term. \n\nThe Digital Journey\n\nIndeed, in order to advise and provide, we must cease using the term \u201cDigital \nTransformation\u201d and rather take a continuous perspective on the digital journey of clients. \n\nCompetition is so fierce in today\u2019s global landscape, that leveraging cutting-edge \ntechnology and deploying new business models is not a one-off pursuit, but rather a \ncontinuous journey of constant iteration and refinement.\n\nFor greater insights on this topic, SoftServe commissioned a study (July 2018) of 703 \ndecision-makers across Financial Services, Retail, Healthcare, Media, and Software \ncompanies in both the United States and the European Union to determine where \nmanagers (and their respective companies) are in their digital journeys. We also asked \nrespondents to rank, in priority, their top five (5) business pain points with a view to \nunderstand what would be best addressed with a digital solution. \n\n\n\nwhitepaper | The Enterprise Digital Journey 4\n\nFinally, we probed further to learn what technologies might be viewed as \u201ccritical\u201d for \nfuture-proofing business, as well as key decision factors when selecting a firm to assist in \nbeginning\u2014or continuing\u2014the digital journey. \n\nWith advising and providing in mind, let\u2019s take a look at the alternate view to Digital \nTransformation\u2014the Enterprise Digital Journey.\n\nThe Enterprise Digital Journey\n\nIn order to address client needs, we must first understand where clients are in their digital \njourney. To achieve this, we asked these 703 respondents to identify with a series of eight \n(8) statuses that can be mapped to four journey states, they are: \n\n\u2022 Reveal \u2013 for clients who are unsure where to begin or how to compete and who are \nlooking for assistance in (re)identifying their market position1 \n \n\n\u2022 Transform \u2013 for clients who have a point of view on where to begin, and need \nassistance from this point forward2 \n\n\u2022 Accelerate \u2013 for more digitally mature clients who are confident in their direction and \nneed expertise in delivering prescribed solutions3  \n\n\u2022 Optimize \u2013 for advanced clients who have realized one or multiple digital solutions, \nand need assistance in calibrating or future-proofing recently launched applications or \narchitectures to reidentify differentiation in the market4\n\n \n\nREVEAL\nWhat\nDecide what  to \ncreate, where to win in \nthe market \n\nINNOVATION\n\nHUMAN EXPERIENCES\n\nTRANSFORM\nHow\nBuild, market, and \ndeliver compelling digital \nexperiences\n\nACCELERATE\nHow Fast\nShip with quality \nfaster than ever \nbefore\n\nOPTIMIZE\nImprove\nContinuously \nenhancing digital \napproach\n\n1.

Digital retail is doing everything \nto make the customer journey as intelligent as possible, while physical retail is moving \nheaven and earth to enrich the customer\u2019s physical and digital experiences.\n\nThe common theme running through many innovations on the near horizon is the power \nof connecting: richer-than-ever data and analytics, exhilarating in-store tech, and a slew \nof new tools retailers can use to connect with customers. 2019 is shaping up to be a year \nenergized with the possibility of brilliant connections, smarter customer insights, and \ninnovative customer experiences in both the digital and physical arenas. Here is a preview.\n\nRebuilding brick-and-mortar: Better, faster, smarter\n\nAs every retailer feels the pressure from Amazon\u2019s prices and delivery speed, physical \nstores are being forced to reinvent themselves to survive and remain relevant within \ntheir category. The good news is that brick-and-mortar stores are making a come-back. \nAmazon has topped the ranking of leading retailers in the UK since 2011, but a current \nBritish consumer sentiment study shows traditional storefronts dominating the 30 most \npopular UK retailers, with Amazon slipping to fourth position, after M&S Simply Food, \nJohn Lewis, and LUSH. \n\nAt the core of this transformation are brilliant physical-digital synergies, offering impactful \nin-store environments. Studies show that many customers are \u201cwebrooming,\u201d i.e. doing \ntheir research digitally before heading into a physical store to purchase the item they \nfound online, because they want to see what they are paying for in real life. What\u2019s \nmore, customers who have researched the retailer site before coming into the store are \n13% more likely to make a purchase. Another study showed that nearly all members of \nGeneration Z actually prefer shopping at brick-and-mortar retailers. \u0410 physical store\u2019s \nseamless connection with the online side of the business is vitally important. As physical \nstores become more digitized, interactive, and tailored to each shopper, they become \nmore impressive and memorable.\n\n0100101011101010110\n1010111001011010101\n0101011010101010110\n1010110101010110101\n0100101011101010110\n1010111001011010101\n0101011010101010110\n1010110101010110101\n\n0100101011101010110\n1010111001011010101\n0101011010101010110\n1010110101010110101\n0100101011101010110\n1010111001011010101\n0101011010101010110\n1010110101010110101\n\n0100101011101010110\n1010111001011010101\n0101011010101010110\n1010110101010110101\n0100101011101010110\n1010111001011010101\n0101011010101010110\n1010110101010110101\n\n0100101011101010110\n1010111001011010101\n0101011010101010110\n1010110101010110101\n0100101011101010110\n1010111001011010101\n0101011010101010110\n1010110101010110101\n\n0100101011101010110\n1010111001011010101\n0101011010101010110\n1010110101010110101\n0100101011101010110\n1010111001011010101\n0101011010101010110\n1010110101010110101\n\n0100101011101010110\n1010111001011010101\n0101011010101010110\n1010110101010110101\n0100101011101010110\n1010111001011010101\n0101011010101010110\n1010110101010110101\n\n0100101011101010110\n1010111001011010101\n\n0100101011101010110\n1010111001011010101\n\n0100101011101010110\n1010111001011010101\n\nhttps://www.consultancy.uk/news/17589/resurgent-bricks-and-mortars-stores-dominate-30-most-popular-uk-retailers\nhttps://www.consultancy.uk/news/17589/resurgent-bricks-and-mortars-stores-dominate-30-most-popular-uk-retailers\nhttps://propmodo.com/technology-will-set-stage-resurgence-brick-mortar-retail/)\nhttps://www.businessinsider.com/study-generation-z-shoppers-prefer-physical-retail-stores-to-online-shopping-2017-1\n\n\nwhitepaper | A Year for Brilliant Connections 3\n\nThere are many examples of experimentation already underway. An offshoot of the \nAmerican department store mega-brand, Nordstrom Local is a 3,000 sq. ft. concept store \ndesigned as a \u201cneighborhood hub\u201d for Los Angeles. Instead of a full-stock inventory, it \nhas manicure stations, a juice bar, comfortable hangout space, and a suite of personal \nstylists on hand. Customers call ahead to book an appointment and are invited to build a \nPinterest-style inspiration board. \n\nStory is another example of the lengths to which retailers will go to connect with \ncustomers by creating fresh new retail experiences. This retailer literally reinvents its \nstore layout and inventory every four to eight weeks so that it can \u201ctell a fresh story\u201d to its \ncustomers. The concept has attracted interest and imitation from Timberland, Target, and \nother major retail chains, including Macy\u2019s, which recently acquired Story. \n\nOfferMoments has developed dynamic billboards that change as customers walk by. They \nturn digital screens into an interactive experience with ads customized to each customer. \nFor example, a mannequin in a retailer\u2019s window display could carry a sensor that \u201ctalks\u201d \nto the smartphones of passersby, enabling the store to send each person a personalized \noffer. It could also mean smart digital screens that use facial recognition to identify the \ncustomer and change the display to something tailored to them based on customer data.\n\nAI and retail: Make it work\n\nNot long ago, marketers and retailers structured communication with customers around \ngross demographic measures such as age, gender, income, and postal code. Today\u2019s \nretailers are using much smarter tech tools to understand customer wants and needs \non a granular level. The main challenge is scaling the one-on-one personal approach to \ninteractions in the millions. This ambitious task would be insurmountable without the \nemergence of artificial intelligence (AI). \n\nAI is one of the top five tech priorities of retailers in 2018, according to Forrester Research. \nA recent Google study also shows that successful marketers and retailers are actively \nemploying AI technologies to connect first-party data across all touchpoints, systems, \ndatabases, websites, and channels: \n\nhttps://www.insider-trends.com/top-25-examples-internet-things-retail/\nhttps://www.forbes.com/sites/richardkestenbaum/2018/01/28/this-is-what-the-retail-industry-is-talking-about-now/#5d60906f7680\nhttps://www.forbes.com/sites/pamdanziger/2017/12/18/story-based-retail-and-the-evolving-role-of-merchandiser/#750e02e26c20\nhttps://www.insider-trends.com/top-25-examples-internet-things-retail/\nhttps://www.forrester.com/report/The+Top+Retail+Technology+Investments+In+2018/-/E-RES139936\nhttps://www.thinkwithgoogle.com/marketing-resources/data-measurement/machine-learning-customer-journey/\n\n\nwhitepaper | A Year for Brilliant Connections 4\n\n\u2022 72% of leading marketers are investing in improving their first-party data capture. \n\n\u2022 81% agree that machine learning will be critical for personalized customer experiences. \n\n\u2022 89% know that anticipating customer needs is critical for growth.\n\nBuilding on this foundation of richer data, AI also helps retailers build more brilliant brands \nthat recognize patterns within data, use automation to efficiently process data flows, and \nleverage predictive models to deeply understand consumer behavior. \n\nWhat does this process look like in practice? Consider high-end retailer Neiman Marcus, \namong today\u2019s trend leaders, using AI and machine learning to triangulate information \nfrom multiple data sources to predict customers\u2019 needs. The ultimate goal is what the \ncompany calls \u201cseamless retail,\u201d where the customer journey is smooth, memorable, and \nwell assisted on all devices, across all touchpoints, at all times. \n\nOther forward-thinking designers such as Tommy Hilfiger, Rebecca Minkoff, and \nCharlotte Tilbury are also crunching data and experimenting with technology to create \npersonalized, experiential stores of the future. During an average five-minute online \nsession at luxury e-commerce site Farfetch in the UK, 15,000 data points are collected on \neach shopper. This amount of data allows Farfetch to provide an advanced, personalized \nexperience for shoppers. \n\nTrying on IoT\n\nInternet of things (IoT) applications are another area where retailers are experimenting. \nTo provide customers with positive, memorable experiences, retailers are combining \nIoT apps with AI-powered analytics. In smart stores, mall traffic can be analyzed across \nseveral retailers to understand the total shopping journey and to customize the in-store \nexperience. With more customers expecting merchandise deliveries overnight, moving \nmerchandise more efficiently is one of the goals of smart transportation apps in retail, \nwhich optimize transport, tracking, and routing. \n\nBut again, how do these promising technologies perform in real life? When Amazon Go \nis fully operational, customers will place items in their baskets and simply walk out of \nthe store when they finish \u201cshopping.\u201d Tags on the products, in the baskets, and at the \nstore entrance are read automatically by the peripheral technology, and the customer\u2019s \nAmazon account is charged without the need to queue at the checkout. Since launching \nan automated packaging service in 2016, Ocado has been able to control and coordinate \n\nhttps://www.forbes.com/sites/jasonbloomberg/2017/11/21/neiman-marcus-maintaining-the-personal-touch-in-a-digital-world/#63c2d82bbf7e\nhttps://howtospendit.ft.com/womens-style/202881-inside-the-shops-of-the-future\nhttps://www.insider-trends.com/top-25-examples-internet-things-retail/\nhttps://www.insider-trends.com/top-25-examples-internet-things-retail/\n\n\nwhitepaper | A Year for Brilliant Connections 5\n\nthe movements of millions of grocery store items and thus accelerate the bagging process \nwhen an online order is made. More than one thousand robots scan thousands of crates \ncontaining a selection of over 47,000 items. \n\nAccording to Global Market Insights, voice shopping with the help of smart speakers such \nas Google Home and Amazon\u2019s Echo will be commonplace by 2024, with over 100 million \nunits sold. The Trade Marketing in Transition report names voice activated assistants like \nAlexa and Google along with the devices that feature them as \u201cthe retail technologies of \ngreatest interest.\u201d \n\nStaying connected with security\n\nWhile trailblazing is key for future retail success, experimentation is not a standalone \nactivity. With security breaches in the news on a daily basis, retailers appreciate the \nneed for robust security. Target made headlines and lost $162 million because it failed to \nproperly secure customer credit card data, resulting in over 70 million customers being \naffected by a breach. In June 2018, Macy's and Adidas both had to deal with security \nbreaches and go public with them. \n\nAs a result, while making a connection with customers is a retailer\u2019s first priority, \nretaining that trust depends on security practices and technologies. The extensive \nvolumes of customer data now being gathered by retailers make them an even more \nattractive target for hackers and other malicious agents looking to benefit from the sale \nof stolen data or demanding ransom payments from victim companies. With technology \nassuming an increasingly pervasive role in the retail sector, the stakes are high, and \nretailers must do everything they possibly can to protect the data they have, convince \ncustomers that their personal data is not vulnerable to misuse, and demonstrate that \ntheir practices are fully compliant with the latest regulations, such as the General Data \nProtection Regulation (GDPR). \n\nAmong the online security measures retailers are taking to protect themselves are \nstoring data off-site via the cloud; updating all software regularly, both in-store and \nonline; incorporating SD-WAN connections and unified threat management (UTM) \nappliances; and encrypting credit card readers. While point of sale (POS) software or \nwebsite plugins may serve as protection in specific segments of a brand\u2019s security \nsystem, retailers must take a proactive and comprehensive approach to anticipate and \nfrustrate ever-evolving cyber threats.\n\nhttps://www.gminsights.com/industry-analysis/smart-speaker-market?utm_source=globenewswire.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=Paid_Globnewswire\nhttps://www.criteo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/criteo-trade-marketing-whitepaper.pdf\nhttps://techcrunch.com/2015/02/25/target-says-credit-card-data-breach-cost-it-162m-in-2013-14/\nhttps://www.mytotalretail.com/article/macys-warns-of-data-breach/\nhttps://www.mytotalretail.com/article/is-security-a-priority-for-your-retail-stores/\n\n\nwhitepaper | A Year for Brilliant Connections 6\n\nBuilding robust cyber defenses today is impossible without AI. Tech consultancy IDC in its \nRetail Insights report estimates that by 2020, 75% of retailers will have adopted AI-based \ncyber-defense technologies. AI-powered security tools provide a time advantage. They also \nallow IT security professionals to shrink the surface for possible cyberattacks by gathering \ninsights and identifying connections and patterns between various types of threats\u2014\nincluding malicious files, suspicious IP addresses, and insider attacks. AI and machine \nlearning also strengthen traditional cyber defense tools, such as WAFs (web application \nfirewalls), allowing them to identify behavioral-based anomalies and fend off a broader \nrange of targeted attacks. \n\nIBM\u2019s 2018 Future of Identity Study reveals that customers now prioritize security over \nconvenience when logging into apps. Interestingly, the study showed that only 19% of US \nconsumers would trust a retail brand to protect their biometric data, as opposed to 57% \nwho trust financial institutions to guard the same data. Another major conclusion of the \nstudy was that young people are often careless with passwords and prefer biometric and \nmultifactor authentication instead. In fact, as many as 41% of millennials reuse log-in and \npassword information to access various sites. If even one site had a security breach, a \ncompromised password would give hackers access to multiple accounts. \n\nNew smart security tools now also address traditional non-tech threats retailers have \nalways faced. Among these is the theft of merchandise. According to the \u201cSay No to \nShoplifting\u201d campaign sponsored by the National Association for Shoplifting Prevention, \nretailers lose nearly $13 billion in stolen goods every year. In-store sensor security and \ntracking of theft is now possible due to the use of RFID technology, facial recognition \nsecurity cameras, GPS trackers in goods, and non-scan POS detection. \n\nConnect with technology to connect with customers \n\nIn a Harvard Business Review article on retailing, economists David S. Evans and Richard \nSchmalensee conclude that: \n\nIt is becoming increasingly clear that retail reinvention isn\u2019t a simple battle to the death between \nbricks and clicks. It is about devising retail models that work for people who are making \nincreasing use of a growing array of Internet-connected tools to change how they search, shop, \nand buy. Creative retailers are using the new technologies to innovate just about everything \nstores do from managing inventory, to marketing, to getting paid. \n\nIn this environment, so rich with experimentation, making brilliant connections with the \ncustomer is critical for success, as is using brilliant technology to enable those connections. \n\nSoftServe works closely with retailers online and in-store, equipping them with the \ntechnological platforms needed to best connect with customers\u2014and stay competitive. \n\nGet started, today.\n\nhttps://www.idc.com/getdoc.jsp?containerId=US43260317\nhttps://www-03.ibm.com/press/us/en/pressrelease/53646.wss\nhttp://www.shopliftingprevention.org/\nhttps://sensornation.com/blogs/news/the-hottest-retail-security-trends-of-2018\nhttps://sensornation.com/blogs/news/the-hottest-retail-security-trends-of-2018\nhttps://hbr.org/2016/05/the-best-retailers-combine-bricks-and-clicks?autocomplete=true\nhttps://softserveinc.com/en-us/contact/\n\n\nABOUT US\nSoftServe is a digital authority that advises and provides at the cutting-\nedge of technology.

Banks must set realistic \nexpectations around the capabilities of utilizing AI. \nThe goal of implementing an AI solution in a bank is \nnot just to embrace a new technology for the sake of \ntechnology or gain internal AI competence, but build \na complex solution to grow from a sandbox PoC into \nproduction at scale. The ultimate goal is to deliver \nlong-term value and replicate success throughout the \nwhole organization.\u201d \n\nBanks must move with the times if they are to \nprovide the products, services, and experiences \nthat today\u2019s customers demand. Technological \nchange has altered the financial landscape forever. \nBanks that do not innovate, evolve, and improve \nwill lose out to more versatile and adaptive \ncompetitors. \n\nAs a banking exec, discover the top four trends \nyou need to address this year to make your \nbusiness a success story.\n\nSoftServe Report\u2014MoneyLIVE 2019, London\n\nKEY \nDIGITAL \nTRENDS \n\nhttps://marketforcelive.com/money-live/\nhttps://marketforcelive.com/money-live/\n\n\nBanks understand the benefits of providing a frictionless customer journey from research through \nto purchase, and beyond. Few, however, understand the means by which to accomplish this. The \nanswer lies in experience design. Moving from a product-centric to a customer-centric approach allows \ncompanies to create compelling customer experiences, services, and products\u2014experience design \nenables this focal shift through a human-centric approach by designing customer experiences up front, \nand quickly validating them before investing in development. Customers want to be empowered to \nmake smart decisions themselves and that means putting the customer journey at the center of every \nbusiness decision. \n\n\u2022 According to a 2018 executive survey \ncarried out by BCG, 86 percent of corporate \nbanking executives agree that digitization \nwill significantly change the economics of \ncorporate banking business models\n\n\u2022 According to Ovum\u2019s ICT Enterprise Insights \n2018-19 report, 64 percent of the world\u2019s banks \nare either planning SaaS-based payments or \npayment hub applications, up from 44 percent \nin 2017, and for payment switches, 56 percent \nof banks are looking for SaaS offerings in 2019, \na 37 percent increase from 2018.\n\nCustomer-centricity skills required \nThere is a need for upgrading user experience, user interface, and experience design\u2014such as \nprototyping and how to be agile and work with empathy in the creative development process. \n\nBigger, faster, and cloudier\u2014the need to capture accurate and actual information at speed and with \nefficiency will be a focal reason why data is so important for banks. The spread of self-service data \nanalytics, along with widespread adoption of the cloud services are leading to many changes. Banks \nthat are winning are the ones that have already focused on big data\n\n\u2022 Successful case studies include ING Bank, who \nis capturing customer data to create in-branch \nand mobile experiences for consumers, and \nBBVA, who take a connected approach to \ncapturing customer data to revolutionize their \ndigital offerings\n\n\u2022 The amount of data generated each second \nwill grow 700 percent by 2020, with banks to \nbe the cornerstone of this explosion (GDC \nprognosis, 2018)\n\nData skills required\nThere is a need for tech knowledge, data analytic skills, geolocation skills, and digital planning big data. \nHaving the correct data will enrich the customer experience, but banks need have a well-designed data \ntransformation strategy to deliver value right from the start.\n\nTHE MAINSTREAM ARRIVAL OF OPEN BANKING\nBanks will face disintermediation due to the unprecedented growth of non-traditional service providers \nentering the market (Monzo has attracted over a million customers). Many banks, such as HSBC and \nSantander have set up in-house innovation labs, which act as access paths to working with the tidal \nwave of new entrants Uber-izing the finance industry. \n\nOpen Banking with APIs provides a more collaborative approach\u2014Nordea is a success story, gaining \nover 300 sign-ups within three days of opening an Open Banking portal for developers. They continue \nto access over a 100 FinTech companies a quarter through Proof of Concept (POC).\n\nTHE NEED TO BE BRILLIANT AT INTEGRATED DATA\n\nMAKE THE CUSTOMER YOUR NUMBER ONE PRIORITY NOW\n\nhttps://www.bcg.com/en-gb/publications/2018/global-corporate-banking-2018-unlocking-success-through-digital.aspx\nhttps://www.bcg.com/en-gb/publications/2018/global-corporate-banking-2018-unlocking-success-through-digital.aspx\nhttps://ovum.informa.com/resources/product-content/cloud-will-move-mainstream-in-the-banking-sector-in-2019-env004-000019\nhttps://ovum.informa.com/resources/product-content/cloud-will-move-mainstream-in-the-banking-sector-in-2019-env004-000019\nhttps://medium.com/datadriveninvestor/big-data-analytics-in-the-banking-sector-b7cb98d27ed2\nhttps://medium.com/datadriveninvestor/big-data-analytics-in-the-banking-sector-b7cb98d27ed2\nhttps://monzo.com/blog/2018/09/24/one-million-monzo-customers\nhttps://nordicapis.com/the-promise-of-open-banking-a-nordea-case-study/\n\n\nNORTH AMERICA\nCharlie Waple, director,  \nfinancial services\ncwapl@softserveinc.com \nTel: +44 (0) 7496 69 7377\n\nEMEA AND APAC\nGuillaume Kendall, director,  \nDLT and FinTech\ngkend@softserveinc.com \nTel: +44 (0) 7888 71 0383\n\nDACH\nRene Pandur, director, \nfinancial services\nrpand@softserveinc.com\nTel: +43 664 5272 783\n\nABOUT US\nSoftServe is a digital authority that advises and provides at the cutting-edge of technology.

Otherwise, \nit will create unnecessary delays and slow \ndown processes, costing your company \nboth time and money. \n\nTakeoff Technologies faced this challenge \nas it sought to scale. As a provider of mi-\ncro-fulfillment centers (MFCs) and related \nservices such as inventor y control and \nmanagement for various industries, our \nclient also wanted to reduce the time it \ntook to onboard and deploy new customer \napplications. \n\nInitially, Takeoff Technologies had manually \ndeployed most configurations, making it \ndifficult to automate routine processes. Be-\ning unable to respond to increasing dynam-\nic demand was costing time and money. \n\nOur client\u2019s architecture was also built ini-\ntially with production and non-production \nresources mixed together. Once deployed, \nit was challenging to go back and change \nthe framework. When projects required \na logical separation of these resources, it \ncaused delays and slowed down the overall \nprocess. \n\nSoftServe took a phased approach to \ntackle these unique issues.

A single organization \ncan use a range of HCM tools to manage \ndiverse employee data (payroll, personal, \nemployment history, or career paths) in \na fast and automated fashion, without \nmoving between environments.  \n\nHere is how we\u2019ve empowered our client \u2014 \na leading provider of workforce and human \ncapital management cloud solutions \u2014to \nunlock this possibility for its partners. \n\nThe company serves tens of thousands of \norganizations\u2014including half of the Fortune \n1,000.

The main features of \nthe product are working with big data and \nservicing huge corporations. These services \n\ninclude writing integration and migration \npackages.  \n\nOur client was planning a new product \nlaunch \u2014 optimized for PaaS offering and \nbuilt on a modern technology stack. To \nsupport this release, the company decided \nto build its new product integration layer \nusing Dell Boomi\u2014a rising platform for \nmanaging, governing, and orchestrating \ndata across applications in the cloud. \nBoomi introduced technology that allowed \nthe users to build and deploy integration \nprocesses using a visual interface and a \ndrag-and-drop technique. This allows the \nimplementation of complex integration \nsolutions in a relatively short period of \ntime. \n\nAs the niche was new and the talent pool \nwas small, our client required expert \nguidance and support to ensure successful \nimplementation.\n\nSoftServe started its cooperation as an \nindependent iPaaS partner. We were the \nfirst to start working with a new business \nunit acquired by Dell that specializes in \ncloud-based integration, API management, \nand Master Data Management (MDM). \n\ncase study |    Easily Manage And Orchestrate Data Across Applications \nWith Dell Boomi    \n\n2\n\n\n\nA fter the initial successfully \ncompleted integration PoC for \nthe client, our partnership grew \n\nboth as a trusted technology advisor \nand implementation partner.

Industries facing the most risk are those with low \nbarriers of entry, which makes it easier for small, agile players with limited \nresources to compete, and ones where market leaders have become \ndependent on legacy business models and infrastructure to generate core \nrevenue. This dependency makes it difficult to implement rapid change, \nfrom both a technology and cultural perspective. \n\nCurrent and future industry leaders must quickly determine what digital \nstrategies will secure their standings in the marketplace and how those \nstrategies can be executed, while simultaneously contending with an \nunprecedented rate of technology innovation.\n\nof respondents do not think they have a winning \nstrategy in place\n\nMORE THAN\n\n50%\n\n9 OUT OF 10 executives believe they are \nmissing major opportunities in the market\n\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10\n\nA partner with established \ntechnology expertise \ncan help prevent the gap \nthat often arises between \nstrategy development and \ntechnical execution.\n\nAccording to a global \nsurvey of senior executives \nby Strategy&, more than \n50% of respondents do not \nthink they have a winning \nstrategy in place.\n\nAnother survey indicated\n9 out of 10 executives believe \nthey are missing major\nopportunities in the market.\n\n\n\nwhitepaper\n\nBUILDING A BUSINESS CASE FOR THE DIGITAL ENTERPRISE 3\n\nBuilding a digital enterprise means empowering your organization with \nthe strategy, tools, and expertise necessary to combat and ultimately \nembrace the latest technology trends. With the right partner in place and a \ncommitment to change, enterprises are no longer stuck playing catch up in \ntoday\u2019s digital environment \u2013 they are once again leading the charge. \n\nThis white paper explores the initial steps necessary for building a business \ncase that will motivate internal stakeholders to consider digital evolution \nwithin their organization, key factors to consider when evaluating a potential \ntechnology partner, and examples of small technology investments that can \nact as a catalyst for wide-scale digital transformation.\n\nThe Five Step Process\n\nA carefully constructed business case is often required for garnering cross-\nfunctional support for engaging with a new technology partner. The business \ncase must articulate how an initial digital investment will guide executives, \nstakeholders, employees, and even the organization\u2019s consumers toward a \ndigital mindset while quickly providing tangible business benefits.  \n\nThe closer a business case is related to a specific business issue, the more \nlikely it is to attract the attention and support of decision makers. At the \nsame time, in order for a project to be successful and have lasting impact, \nit must establish achievable goals and reasonable parameters, including a \nrealistic timeline and budget. \n\nThe five-step process we describe below is designed to guide your thinking \nas you develop the business case for your organization\u2019s transformation. \nEvery organization \u2013 in fact, every professional \u2013 will tackle this process a bit \ndifferently, but these five themes are crucial for building initial confidence in \na project, securing funding for the investment, and setting the foundation for \na successful partnership. \n\n\n\nwhitepaper\n\nBUILDING A BUSINESS CASE FOR THE DIGITAL ENTERPRISE 4\n\n1. Define a business issue.\n\nFirst outline what business issue you plan to tie to your proposal. It might \nfeel natural to start with your organization\u2019s pain points, but in the digital \nera, exploring untapped opportunity can be just as worthwhile and lead \nto the creation of new competitive advantages. The issue can be specific \nor broad; it can be tied to a specific domain or corporate function \u2013 or not. \nWhatever your problem or opportunity might be, the act of defining that \nissue in concrete terms will make it easier to develop a solid business case \nand often ensures others will see value in the project from the start.\n\n2. Recognize potential pitfalls.\n\nNext try to identify what obstacles might make it difficult to implement \nchange. Too many legacy systems? Intra-corporate resistance to change? \nIs there a cultural aversion to outside help? Have similar projects failed \nin the past? If so, why? To be clear, this does not have to be the time for \naddressing those problems. It\u2019s more important to reflect honestly about \nyour organization\u2019s weaknesses to ensure your project isn\u2019t unnecessarily \nderailed in the future. \n\nWhen Einstein was asked how he would \nsave the world in one hour, he said he would \nspend 55 minutes defining the problem and \n5 minutes solving it.\n\n\n\nwhitepaper\n\nBUILDING A BUSINESS CASE FOR THE DIGITAL ENTERPRISE 5\n\n3. Catalogue organizational strengths.\n\nIn the same vein, take time to consider what resources and features your \norganization has that might offer advantages and inspire confidence among \nyour team. Have you had success with transforming corporate processes and \nnew technology adoption before? Do you have an in-house team of digital \nchampions or industry veterans at your disposal? What other assets do you \nhave that a competitor might not be able to call on? Since most modern \nenterprises are already data-driven, what data are you collecting? Do you \nknow your customers? How loyal are they? How valuable is your brand?\n\n4. Establish high-level goals. \n\nOnce you know what your problem or opportunity is, and you\u2019ve taken the \ntime to examine the circumstances that will surround your project, you \ncan then establish business-oriented goals. What would you like to see \nas a result of this effort? In an ideal world, how would internal processes \nimprove? How will this project impact the user experience (and are we \ntargeting internal or external users)? This is a great time to start reaching \nout to potential partners who can help you navigate current trends and \nvalidate your goals from a technology perspective.\n\n5. Identify how you will measure impact.\n\nFinally, it\u2019s time to consider how you will measure the success of your \nproject. What metrics can speak to those high-level goals? What short-term \nROI will appease relevant stakeholders? What tangible change will mean \nthe engagement was a success and the partnership was worthwhile? This \nis the best time to begin estimating budgets, timelines, and resources that \ncan be dedicated to the project, with the support of an experienced digital \ntransformation partner.\n\n\n\nwhitepaper\n\nBUILDING A BUSINESS CASE FOR THE DIGITAL ENTERPRISE 6\n\nEvaluating a Digital Transformation Partner\n\nOnce the decision has been made to move forward with the support of outside \nhelp, you and your team will be responsible for deciding what group will best \nfit the constraints of your project and complement the culture and structure of \nyour organization. Of course, digital services partners often represent long-term \ncommitments and multiple complex projects, so it\u2019s as important to consider \nfuture requirements as it is to think through your more immediate needs. \n\nIt\u2019s a good idea to begin evaluating potential partners within an established \nframework sooner rather than later. They can offer objective insights and help \ninform a solid business case, and you will be able to move forward faster once \nyour engagement receives the greenlight. The following list explores four factors \nto keep in mind while developing your business case and again when it comes \ntime to select a potential partner:  \n\nTechnology Expertise\n\nFirst and foremost, determine whether a prospective team has the objectivity, \nexpertise, and manpower to spearhead a digital evolution for your organization. \nMany business leaders start their search with traditional management and \nprofessional services consultants, but more and more enterprises are choosing \nto cut out the middleman and work directly with technology experts. The best \npartners will have a wide variety of expertise to call on. Not only does this \nsignificantly cut down on cost, it ensures your strategy is closely aligned with \nyour technical implementation and improves project oversight.\n\nIndustry Familiarity \n\nWhile every organization and project is unique, it\u2019s important your partner \nunderstands the trends characteristic of your particular industry. Ask for \nexamples of similar projects to ensure some level of familiarity. Still, keep in \nmind you and your team know your company and your industry better than \nany third-party. It\u2019s most important your partner understands the context \nsurrounding your organization, values a collaborative working process, and \nhas experience addressing the types of issues you face. \n\n\n\nwhitepaper\n\nBUILDING A BUSINESS CASE FOR THE DIGITAL ENTERPRISE 7\n\nInformed Thinking \n\nIdeal digital services partners strike a balance between big-picture thinkers \nand real-world problem solvers. There should be ample evidence early on \nthat a partner\u2019s guidance is the result of active listening and a careful study \nof the nuances that make up your organization. The best partners do not \nsimply tell you what to do or implement an existing strategy; instead, they \ncollaborate with you to address your needs and stick around to help you \nbuild flexible, scalable, and long-lasting solutions. \n\nProject Deliverables\n\nWith that in mind, make sure to determine what deliverables a partner \nintends to hand off at the end of a project and what resources they will \ncall on to deliver them. Many consultations result in strategy documents \ndestined to collect dust on a shelf after the engagement comes to an \nend; others outsource their development projects because they lack in-\nhouse technical expertise. Digital transformation is more likely to succeed \nwhen your staff members are able to work directly with the digital experts \nresponsible for both strategy planning and execution.\n\nDid you know?\nTwo of the \u201cBig Four\u201d \nprofessional services \nnetworks and the world\u2019s \nlargest strategy consulting \nfirm rely on SoftServe to \ndevelop and implement\nend-to-end technology \nsolutions for their clients. \n\n2\n\n4\n\n1 3\n\nTWO OF THE \u201cBIG FOUR\u201d\n\n\u201cB\nIG\n\n F\nO\n\nU\nR\n\n\u201d\n\n\n\nwhitepaper\n\nBUILDING A BUSINESS CASE FOR THE DIGITAL ENTERPRISE 8\n\nSmall Wins Lead to Big Change\n\nTo be sure, \u201cdigital transformation\u201d is a vague idea and lofty goal. Though \nit\u2019s evident the majority of enterprises understand the benefits of a modern \ndigital approach, many are still struggling to define a path for moving \nforward. Starting with a relatively small investment is often a necessary \nand effective first step for encouraging more wide-spread support for a \nlong-term relationship with a prospective partner. Below we discuss three \nexamples of small initiatives that can quickly create meaningful change and \nset the stage for a cultural shift toward a digital-first mentality. \n\nIdeation Workshop \n\nIn an ideation workshop, several internal business leaders meet with a \nteam of external digital experts to generate and explore potential initiatives. \nUnlike open-ended brainstorming sessions, ideation workshops are \npurposefully structured and tend to result in actionable insights. Sometimes \na working prototype is designed and even tested before the end of the \nevent; other times the group focuses on persona mapping, which is the \ngroundwork for Experience Design. These intense workshops represent a \nrelatively small investment and can lead to innovative thinking that might \nnot otherwise be possible in a traditional business environment. \n\nAdvanced Analytics\n\nMost organizations today aspire to become more data-driven, and data \nis rapidly becoming one of an enterprise organization\u2019s most valuable \nresources. Big Data and advanced analytics allow us to identify and \nexamine trends, predict the immediate and long-term future, and improve \nand expedite decision making. Recently, for one enterprise retailer, \nSoftServe built a functional PoC and tested it against real-life scenarios \nin a matter of weeks. Data analysis was reduced from months of manual \nexploration to minutes, thanks to advanced analytics.\n\n\n\nwhitepaper\n\nBUILDING A BUSINESS CASE FOR THE DIGITAL ENTERPRISE 9\n\nPenetration Testing \n\nWith penetration testing, a team of Certified Ethical Hackers (CEH) use \nthe same methods as online criminals to test the strength of a network\u2019s \ninternal and external infrastructure and identify weaknesses leaving an \norganization vulnerable to an attack. After thorough analysis, the team then \ndelivers a potential impact assessment and concrete recommendations \nfor remediation. This exercise is a great way to inspire confidence in a new \npartner while uncovering security gaps that left unchecked, could become \nsignificant liabilities.\n\nAccording to a 2016 survey conducted by the Ponemon Institute, only 41% \nof executive and staff employees said they were prepared to respond to a \nbreach of confidential business information or intellectual property.\n\nare prepared to respond to a data breach\n\nONLY 41%\n\n\n\nwhitepaper\n\nBUILDING A BUSINESS CASE FOR THE DIGITAL ENTERPRISE 10\n\nAbout SoftServe\n\nWith over 20 years of experience in digital software development and \nconsulting, SoftServe is a global leader in solving complex business \nproblems, creating industry disrupting technology and accelerating growth \nand innovation while optimizing operational efficiency.

In its current state, the \nunstructured data lacked usable dimensions for creating analytics without extensive additional \nprocessing. One area the client sought to evaluate was the transaction entity. This could provide \nan analysis of the dynamics around a benefactor\u2019s payment. Yet even a simple rules-based system \ncouldn't analyze the data effectively due to issues including entities with very close names that \nmade processing impossible. \n\nThe client approached SoftServe about finding a solution to \nextract this kind of monetizable information from their data. \n\nOur experts collaborated with the client\u2019s team and concluded that a deep learning model was \nrequired. The model would be based on active learning principles, accelerating the creation of          \na training dataset interactively. \n\nANALYZE, MANAGE, AND MONETIZE YOUR BUSINESS DATA SETS. \n\n\n\n3case study |   Drive Actionable Data Classification And Use\u00a0With\u00a0Deep Learning\u00a0Using\u00a0Amazon Web Services\n\nTo solve the classification issue, SoftServe\u2019s team used entity names as a target variable and transaction \nnames as the model input. We built the deep learning model architecture by embedding and using \nbidirectional LSTM layers with a DistilBert transformer tokenizer. For around 2M trainable parameters, \nthis structure kept the model at less than 25MB. \n\nFinding a way to manage, structure, and monetize massive amounts of data requires a digital authority \nwith the experience of building deep learning solutions. SoftServe\u2019s extensive deep learning expertise \nmeant our client could successfully utilize their data and drive new opportunities.  \n\nThe client was so happy with these \nresults that one of the company's co-\nfounders said they were \u201cincredibly \nimpressed with the SoftServe \nexperience.\u201d This leader \u201cloved that \nSoftServe came with prior conviction \non what would be needed to complete \nthe project to help it get off the ground \nin the early days.\u201d However, they \n\"also appreciated the willingness to \ntransition to high priority items as \nthe project progressed, even if they \ndeviated from the original gameplan.\u201d \nBest of all, the co-founder \u201cfound the \ncollaboration and teamwork elements \nto be wonderful\u201d and looks forward to \nworking with SoftServe in the future. \n\nUltimately, this deep learning \nmodel provided our client with the \ncomprehensive structure needed \nfor analyzing their data. It created \na multilabel classification for about \n1,500 entities and a final training \ndataset of around 30,000 rows. \nThis resulted in a nearly 95% entity \nrecognition accuracy rate based \non entirely new data.

The primary objective was to maximize well life and increase production rates by optimizing \nESP systems. We created a proof of concept (PoC) phase that included the ML model trained on small data samples and \ndashboard prototyping. Check out this PoC case study here. \n\nAfter the project\u2019s first phase, we moved to the pilot phase to extend the existing functionality and unveil a completed model \nthat can be applied to all wells currently in operation. \n\nDuring the PoC phase, we established \nrelationships in well controls and \nidentified optimization opportunities. Our \nfocus during the PoC was on optimizing \nESPs that had been running at a stable \nfrequency for a while and were not \nshowing signs of gas locking, critical scale \nbuildup, or pump malfunctioning. \n\nBy addressing these optimization \nopportunities, we demonstrated the \npotential for even greater improvements \nin efficiency and performance and proved \nthe technology's ability to safely boost \nproduction. \n\nAfter the PoC, development efforts were \nfocused on scaling the solution to all \nwells running on ESPs. A top priority was \ncreating effective approaches for anomaly \ndetection, such as gas interference at an \nearly stage, scale buildup, near-fracking \nactivities, and many others. To achieve \nthis, multiple machine learning (ML) \nmodels and dashboards were created. \nAnomaly detection ML models were \n\nincorporated into an equipment health \nand data monitoring system, along with a \ndeveloped data quality monitoring system. \n\nAdditional data annotation and \ninterpretation solutions were presented \nto help capture subject matter experts' \nknowledge and incorporate it into the  \nML models. \n\nAs a result, the ESP optimization solution \nis now enhanced with additional models \nand dashboards, making it more valuable \nand creating a highly scalable solution that \ncan work under different circumstances \nand configurations.   \n\nBUSINESS CHALLENGE\n\nhttps://www.softserveinc.com/en-us/resources/boost-oil-production-by-optimizing-esp-with-ai\n\n\nCase Study   |   Boost Oil Production by Optimizing Operating Parameters of an ESP with AI 3\n\nTHE APPROACH\nThe SoftServe and Vital Energy teams collaborated on ESP well \nproduction optimization, focusing on an ML model designed for \naccurate production forecasting. The model takes ESP telemetry \ndata and well production rates for the days before prediction and \npredicts well production for the following day with given ESP control \nparameters. In addition, the ML model predicts ESP telemetry for \nthe next day. This approach allows the client to not only predict \nwater, gas, and oil outcomes for different control parameters to find \nthe most optimal ones but also describe the approximate state of \nthe system (temperatures, pressures, power consumption, etc.).  \n\nConceptually, the solution consists of two parts: \n\nAutomated python scripts that \nrun with AWS step functions  \n\nThe dashboards  \nvisualizing the results  \n\nThe SoftServe team developed the \ndata processing and visualization parts, \na set of automated python scripts \nand dashboards with well production \noptimizations and model forecasts \nanalysis. The dashboards allow users \nto interact with the developers and the \nmodel itself with optimization feedback \nand telemetry constraint forms. \n\nWith the introduction of the analytics \nportal, all existing and new dashboards \nare available in one place. Access to \nthe data and insights, cooperation, \nand solution adoptions are even more \nstraightforward. Dashboard access \nis restricted based on the user\u2019s role. \nUsers, user groups, and dashboard  \ncards can be managed from the admin \npanel. The analytics portal is easily \naccessible from any type of device: \nmobile, tablet, and desktop. It also \nallows for the quick deployment of new \ndashboards to production, making it \npossible to test new machine learning \nmodels and routines right after the \nprototyping phase. \n\n\n\nCase Study   |   Boost Oil Production by Optimizing Operating Parameters of an ESP with AI 4\n\n\n\nCase Study   |   Boost Oil Production by Optimizing Operating Parameters of an ESP with AI 5\n\n\n\nCase Study   |   Boost Oil Production by Optimizing Operating Parameters of an ESP with AI 6\n\nTHE SOFTSERVE TEAM HELPED DEVELOP \nTWO MORE DASHBOARDS: \n\nNumber and \npercentage missing \ncritical tags.  \n\nList of available data \nsources and their \nassociated completeness \npercentage. \n\nPercentage of tag  \nvalue duplicates, zeros, \nout of operational and \nhistorical statistical \nranges. \n\nPercentage  \nof anomalies and \nrelative completeness \nand data frequency \nchanges.\n\nThe Data Health Monitoring dashboard allows the client to monitor the data completeness and prioritize wells with the highest  \nnumber of NAs or noise for further inspection.

It also enables the labeling \nof these and other events for further ML model \nre-training.  \n\nESPs have gas lock and PID controllers that \nactivate when there is too much gas in the \nsystem. Gas lock events lead to a reduction in oil \nproduction and faster equipment deterioration. \nThe current gas inference detection algorithm \nprovides operators with daily forecasts of gas \ninterference events that provide early warning \nsigns about potential gas locks. \n\nThe current pipeline provides real-time \nmonitoring of ESP system data for ~80 wells, \nwhich contain enough telemetry for reliable \npredictions. The developed dashboard also allows \nusers to label gas interference and any other \nanomalous events in the ESP operations history. \nThe early detection of a potential gas lock allows \noperators to adjust the system to prevent or \npostpone PID or gas lock recovery modes from \nenabling. Preventing 20% of gas lock events \nends up in an additional ~1000 days/year for \n~80 wells working in the normal model. In total, \navoiding gas lock for 1000 days would result in an \nadditional 1\u20135 thousand barrels of oil. \n\n0\n\n200\n\n400\n\n600\n\nMotor\n\nMotor - Current Motor - Underload Motor - Overload\n\n0\n\n1000\n\n2000\n\n3000\n\nDaily Production\n\nalloc_gas_vol alloc_oil_vol alloc_water_vol\n\nOFF\n\nNormal\n\nGaslock\n\nPID\n\nRun Status\n\nPID mode Gas Lock mod Normal mode Not working\n\n0\n\n0.2\n\nMar 2022 May 2022 Jul 2022 Sep 2022 Nov 2022 Jan 2023 Mar 2023\n\n0.4\n\n0.8\nPredicted gas interference\n\n1\n\n0.6\n\nGas Interference Probability\n\nGas interference probability\n\n\n\nCase Study   |   Boost Oil Production by Optimizing Operating Parameters of an ESP with AI 9\n\nVALUE  \nDELIVERED \nSoftServe helped Vital Energy optimize operations and make \nthe move to automated decision-making, resulting in increased \noil and gas production.

It includes tools for risk \nassessment, compliance tracking, performance monitoring, \nworkforce management, built-in reporting, and supply chain \nanalytics. By using the Connect platform, users can reduce the \nnumber of safety incidents by as much as 55% compared to \nindustry averages. \n\nHere's how we helped Avetta improve its product and achieve its \nbusiness goals. \n\nImagine you\u2019re the CEO of a company that sells a supply chain \nmanagement solution. Business is good, and you\u2019re serving your \ncustomers and meeting their growing demands. \n\nYour customers want a feature to know how financially healthy \ntheir global supply chain network is, on demand. So, you expand \nyour current platform to include this new feature. \n\nSo far, so good. Your tech team is already busy running the \nbusiness. You can\u2019t slow down operations while adding new \nfeatures to your offering. \n\nThat was the challenge our contractor management software \nclient faced. Headquartered in Orem, Utah,\u00a0Avetta LLC\u00a0helps \norganizations in more than 120 countries manage contractual \nsupply chain compliance with their SaaS-based solution.\u00a0\n\nOVERVIEW\n\nhttps://www.avetta.com/\nhttps://www.avetta.com/platform\n\n\nCase Study   |   Avetta Expands a Supply Chain Platform Solution With SoftServe 3\n\nCHALLENGES\nAvetta tried to meet its product managers\u2019 roadmap and had begun \nmaking big improvements for Avetta\u2019s customers. Avetta needed to \ncontinue to meet customer and market demands while developing \na new feature, so they decided to leverage a partner. \n\nAvetta needed to build a full exchange-to-exchange solution, \nincluding technology and potential work backlogs. The company \nespecially needed to release timelines that its team could commit to \nthe executive team. \n\nAvetta also wanted to expand its product stack to provide \ncustomers with a better view of their global supply chain network\u2019s \nfinancial health. Other features needed were the ability to access \nsupplier financial metrics across geographic boundaries, report \nlegal findings, and monitor business risks using values from such \n\nsources as the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) and Adverse \nMedia Screening. \n\nIn addition, Avetta wanted to bring more third-party data into their \nsystem with the help of integrations to enhance decision-making on \nsuppliers who work for their clients. Users also wanted the ability to \ncheck their supplier\u2019s current regulatory compliance and improved \nsupplier evaluations, which would make the entire supply chain \nsafer and more efficient. \n\nSoftServe began with design, which included a business and \ntechnology analysis and what was needed to successfully complete \nthe project.\n\n\n\nCase Study   |   Avetta Expands a Supply Chain Platform Solution With SoftServe 4\n\nSOLUTION\nSoftServe\u2019s technology team developed application programming \ninterface (API) integrations within the existing platform and \nbuilt additional APIs with multiple third-party financial and \ncybersecurity partners. This included the Federal Motor Carrier \nSafety Administration (FMCSA), an agency of the U.S. Department of \nTransportation (DOT).  \n\nWhile Avetta has a skilled and experienced technical team, \nSoftServe brought its own expertise to the project. This included \nthe latest industry best practices. By working with Avetta\u2019s technical \nteam as peers, we built trust in the solution we were helping Avetta \nto create.\n\nAs the project\u2019s integration partner, we worked with Avetta to build \nthese solutions. The team:\n\nSoftServe applied the extract, transform, and load (ETL) integration \nprocess to increase the number of services provided by Avetta to \nthe clients on its platform. By developing new integrations for our \nclient, Avetta\u2019s user interface can now be used to monitor business \nrisks such as OFAC/Sanctions and Adverse Media.  \n\nWe offered a solution that used multiple frontend and backend \nplatforms, including Elm, JavaScript, Scala, and MongoDB. \n\nAddressed \ntechnical \n\nproblems and \nother challenges\n\nPrepared a data \nflow visualization\n\nOffered technical \nadvice \n\nPLANNING\nEach project was broken into four phases: discovery, \nimplementation, enhancement, and closure. The discovery \nphase included the examination of each separate integration \nto understand Avetta\u2019s key business objectives. This would \nprovide the information and data necessary to develop the \napproach and implementation plans.  \n\nThe SoftServe team started the implementation, \nenhancement, and closure phases of the project following the \nScrum approach to deliver tangible results in every sprint.\n\n\n\nCase Study   |   Avetta Expands a Supply Chain Platform Solution With SoftServe 5\n\nFor the financial risk integration implementation, we suggested \nadditional features be implemented within Avetta\u2019s existing \nConnect platform after a series of formal meetings with their \nleadership and team members. These features would allow \nConnect users to search for up-to-date business supplier profiles \nby using various API calls. Risk score fields could also be obtained \nfrom financial partners and populated into MongoDB.  \n\nThen, following the data aggregation and analytics performed \nby Avetta\u2019s analytics team, the data could be converted and \ndisplayed within the Avetta Connect application. Keeping in mind \nthe default configuration rules and flags.  \n\nSoftServe worked closely with the financial partner team to \nmeet these requirements, since they are the scores provider. The \n\nfinancial partner team changed the request of data, and the data \nflow several times because of changes made in the API. Therefore, \nwe researched and proposed the most efficient approach.  \n\nThis overall solution provided Avetta\u2019s clients and internal users \nwith the necessary business intelligence capabilities to search \nfor financial information, find and request reports, and check \nsupplier compliance.  \n\nFollowing the successful integration implementation, the \nSoftServe team continues to work on the FMCSA and cyber \npartner integration implementations using the same approach. \nThe team makes specific technical decisions for each case \nto ensure Avetta customers get the most value from those \nintegration results. \n\nTHE PROJECT\n\n\n\nCase Study   |   Avetta Expands a Supply Chain Platform Solution With SoftServe 6\n\nRESULTS\n\nLET\u2019S TALK!\n\nCONCLUSION\nFor the financial integration, SoftServe extended \nthe functionalities within Avetta\u2019s Connect \nplatform, which allowed Avetta\u2019s clients to search \nfor up-to-date business supplier profiles. Our \nteam used one API call to show business risk \nscores for each selected supplier. The API displays \ninformation regarding sanctions, Adverse Media, \nbankruptcy, and other pertinent information in \nConnect if available. \n\nOur task in the FMCSA implementation was to \nstore data obtained from the DOT in Avetta\u2019s \ndatabase, which Avetta\u2019s customers could then \naccess in the Connect platform. Now, Avetta\u2019s \nclients can search for carriers that are compliant \nwith DOT regulations and check a carrier\u2019s \nprofile for data regarding unsafe driving, vehicle \nmaintenance, and other information. \n\nFinally, SoftServe provided supplier risk \nmonitoring in Connect by linking to the cyber \npartner\u2019s APIs.\n\nThis engagement, which consisted of three separate project \nimplementations, proved successful for Avetta. Operationally, our \nsolution allowed Avetta\u2019s clients to perform company searches \non suppliers to gain better insights into the global supply chain \nnetwork\u2019s financial health, transportation safety, and cybersecurity. \nThis also included the ability to access supplier financial metrics \nacross geographic boundaries. \n\nFinancial integration was important to Avetta because it provided \ntheir clients with a risk and liability feature set within the company\u2019s \nproducts. \n\n\u201cThe team at SoftServe has been a fantastic partner,\u201d said \nCarrie Garrett, Avetta Program Manager. \u201cTheir work has been \nconsistently delivered on time or ahead of schedule. There is a clear \ncommitment to quality and simply \u2018doing the right thing.\u2019 I cannot \nsay enough good things about this team!\u201d \n\nSoftServe provided Avetta with the expertise necessary to deliver \neach project successfully, from building the right plan to creating \nthe right estimates. The team also developed the right budget and \ncommitted features set to identify the right software development \nlife cycle. \n\nIf the problem we solved for Avetta is a challenge for you, learn how \nSoftServe can help you build API integrations for your platform.\n\nhttps://www.softserveinc.com/en-us/contact\n\n\nAbout SoftServe\nWe are advisors, engineers, and designers who deliver innovation, quality, \nand speed \u2014 elevating and accelerating our clients\u2019 digital journeys.\n\nOur approach is built on a foundation of empathetic, human-focused experience \ndesign that ensures value and continuity from concept to release.\n\nNORTH AMERICAN HQ\n\n201 W 5th Street, Suite 1550 \nAustin, TX 78701 \n+1 866 687 3588 (USA)            \n+1 647 948 7638 (Canada) \n\nContacts\n\ninfo@softserveinc.com \nwww.softserveinc.com\n\nSocial Links\n\nEUROPEAN HQ\n\n30 Cannon Street\nLondon EC4 6XH\nUnited Kingdom  \n+44 333 006 4341\n\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/company/softserve/\nhttps://www.youtube.com/user/SoftServeInc\nhttps://twitter.com/SoftServeInc\nhttps://www.facebook.com/SoftServeCompany\n\n", "LocationURL": "https://www.softserveinc.com/files/cases/avetta-expands-a-supply-chain-platform-solution-softserve.pdf", "id": "sw-rf-913", "FileName": "avetta-expands-a-supply-chain-platform-solution-softserve.pdf", "Storage": "SoftServe Website", "Published": "2023-05-25T09:15:32Z", "FileType": ".pdf"}, {"Category": null, "content": "\nDIGITAL \nEXPERIENCE \nPLATFORMS \n\nBUILD TRUST, CREATE LOYALTY, AND DELIVER \nVALUE TO HCPs AND THEIR PATIENTS \n\n3 FEATURES OF DXPs\n\nPUT THE HEALTHCARE PROFESSIONAL (HCP) IN THE CENTER \n\n1 2\n\nDigital experience platforms (DXPs) enable pharma, biotech, and medical device companies  \nto seamlessly manage the delivery and optimization of personalized experiences across various  \ndevices, channels, and touchpoints.  \n\nTo be successful, companies need to create a single view of HCPs and patients, a mission requiring \ndata integration across various silos.

In a recent survey, 67% of organizations classified \nthemselves as either \u201cpure agile\u201d or \u201cleaning towards agile.\u201d And in another, 98% of \nrespondents said that their organization has realized success from agile projects.\n\nIn this white paper, we\u2019ll explore why and how to redesign a legacy software development \nlifecycle (SDLC) to go from waterfall to agile, and transitioning to test automation to fit  \nthis model.\n\nWhat Does \u201cGoing Agile\u201d Mean?\nGoing agile is great for projects that have tight deadlines. In theory, agile software \ndevelopment means implementing shorter iterations and more frequent delivery. In practice, \nthis means that there are no roadmaps or requirements; the project begins with a lower \nquality product that goes through multiple, rapid iterations until it reaches its final stage.\n\nOn the front end, the agile method allows for changing priorities as they appear, and  \nis perfect for projects that require a fast turnaround. At SoftServe, we advise and consult  \non the best practices for each particular project, and use metrics and data to transform  \nthe process.\n\n2whitepaper | Be More Agile: Redesign Your SDLC\n\nAnalysis\n\nDesign\n\nCode\n\nTest\n\nAnalysis\n\nDesign\n\nCode\n\nTest\n\nTimeTime\n\nAgile SDLC  \u2013 Simultaneous ActivitiesSDLC  \u2013 Sequential Activities\n\nhttps://techbeacon.com/survey-agile-new-norm\nhttp://www.agile247.pl/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/versionone-11th-annual-state-of-agile-report.pdf\n\n\nOn the back end, it\u2019s important to have the ability to adjust and react quickly. To accomplish \nthis type of speed requires high team morale and a collaborative attitude. A conflict with any \ntechnical product management group can usually be resolved by hiring a technical product \nmanager, who can be brought on-site to bridge any gaps between teams. Without the \ncooperation of the entire team, communication becomes impossible and the project will fall \napart. We will revisit this idea again later.\n\nTesting and Project Management: Agile vs. Traditional\n\nTransitioning to an agile methodology also requires rethinking your testing processes.\n\nTraditionally, testing was done manually and sequentially, which can be fine for smaller \nprojects but disastrous for larger ones. Manually testing for bugs and defects is time-\nconsuming and tedious, and for larger projects that require faster turnover rates, this creates \na lot of problems with time overhead. This traditional model is also outdated in that its main \npurpose is to find problems within the system, making it a reactive methodology instead of a \nproactive one.\n\nIn the agile SDLC, everything is set up to move much faster and more proactively. Say \nyou have two weeks to go live on something, with one or two days for testing. The agile \nmethodology works with these types of deadlines in mind, and can work even faster and \nmore thoroughly by implementing test automation. Test automation allows for bigger \nvolume-projects, and prevents bugs and defects instead of focusing on seeking them out.\n\nTest Automation\nTest automation is a second step that pairs with going agile \u2014 it\u2019s necessary in a fast-paced \nenvironment and shortens the turnaround cycle. Typical automation tests include unit \ntesting, integration testing, GUI testing, and performance testing.\n\n3whitepaper | Be More Agile: Redesign Your SDLC\n\nTraditional  (find bugs)\n\nUnit\nTests\n\nAutomation\nSuites\n\nManual Tests\nthrough UI\n\nAgile  (prevent bugs)\n\nAutomated UI Tests / \nExploratory Testing\n\nAutomated\nAcceptance Tests\n\nUnit\nTests\n\n\n\nAgile project development and its multiple rounds of iterations come with a greater number \nof automated test cases. Rather than manually checking their quality, which can waste time \nand overhead, quick assessment through test automation allows the project to move swiftly. \nTest automation also sheds light on both process and implementation findings that are easy \nto fix and better perfect the test solution.\n\nHere\u2019s a general overview for how to implement test automation.\n\nTest Automation in an Agile SDLC Process\n\nBut starting test automation can lead to failure without the experience of seasoned \nprofessionals. It\u2019s important to engage experienced experts to achieve the best and most \nvaluable automated quality testing.\n\n4whitepaper | Be More Agile: Redesign Your SDLC\n\nOne Time Activity Iterative\n\nDesign Develop Execute Maintain\n\nReview \nroadmap\n\nReview manual \ntest cases\n\nVerify testability\n\nSelection of \nautomation \ncandidates\n\nDefine tests \nstrategy\n\nRefactor \nmanual \ntests to be \nready for test \nautomation\n\nFramework \ndesign\n\nPlan reusable \nlibraries\n\nDefine other \nabstraction \nlayers\n\nData \nmanagement \nplan\n\nCreate test \nscripts\n\nData \nmanagement \n\nBuild execution \nflow\n\nRecovery \nscenarios\n\nAdd to function \nlibraries\n\nTool extensions\n\nRepository \nmanagement\n\nDocumentation\n\nCreate new test \nenvironment\n\nDeploy test \nsuite\n\nExecute test \nscripts \n\nResults \nreporting\n\nDefect \nmanagement\n\nUpdate assets\n\nArchive test \nsuite\n\nMaintain test \nsuite\n\nRegression \ntests\n\nPlan\n\n\n\nFinding the Right Partner to Redesign SDLC\nSuccess in going agile and implementing test automation is only as good as the team who \ncan successfully put it into action. At SoftServe, our teams have helped with countless SDLC \nredesign projects, such as helping Kyivstar redesign their SDLC to improve their mobile \nservices by up to 30%. Here are our secrets to success.\n\nOne of the most common reasons for failed outsourcing projects \nis insufficient attention given to setting and aligning expectations, \nunderstanding real needs behind formal requirements, and further \ngovernance of the project execution.\n\nSetting the Right Goals\nWhen it comes to redesigning an SDLC, the best approach starts with successful \ncollaboration and clear project goals \u2014 especially when implementing the agile \nmethodology. Things move more quickly, and so the right objectives need to be set with the \nfull support of all parties. The best way to do this is to uncover potential project challenges \nfrom the very beginning to help you get the full set of benefits that come from outsourcing.\n\nAt SoftServe, our process focuses on analyzing team structure, development processes, \nbusiness domains and tools, as well as identifying gaps, risks, and opportunities that need to \nbe addressed in order to refine and optimize the entire collaboration process.\n\nAn effective workshop is conducted at a client\u2019s site and brings together key stakeholders \nwho will be impacted by the outsourcing initiative.\n\nWorkshops take from 3 to 6 hours and consist of group discussions and individual follow-ups \non things such as:\n\n \u2022 Expectations and value management\n \u2022 Sourcing opportunity analysis\n \u2022 Engagement approach definition\n \u2022 Current project, process, product management practices\n \u2022 Knowledge management\n \u2022 Measurement of quality, productivity and predictability\n\n5whitepaper | Be More Agile: Redesign Your SDLC\n\nhttps://www.softserveinc.com/en-us/news/softserve-transforms-and-optimizes-kyivstar-sdlc/\n\n\nMonitoring Execution vs. Goals\nSuccessful projects rely on a careful balance of monitoring execution against the goals  \nthat are set in place. Important metrics provide insight as to the velocity and quality  \nof estimates, quality/issues open/reopen, cycle time, and other product quality  \nassessment measurements.\n\nAt SoftServe, our Abiliton dashboard tracks projects and metrics, using them as a measuring \ntool to gauge project success. When switching to an agile environment, keeping track of \nproject timelines and goals is imperative. Velocity and quality estimates allow you to uncover \nhow much time your team needs to produce quality product value.\n\nThe best, most commonly used quality measurements include:\n\n \u2022 The number of issues open\n \u2022 The number of issues fixed\n \u2022 And the number of issues re-opened\n\nFinding the Right Technology Experts\nRedesigning a legacy software development process requires expertise. In a fast-moving, \nagile development process, it\u2019s more important than ever to rely on those who have \nsuccessfully accomplished these projects before.\n\nAt SoftServe, we use our market-leading methodology to seek out and maintain a team \nof technology experts. We have a unique approach to software development based on \nthe effective team work of highly qualified professionals, the use of agile development \nmethodology, and advanced technologies. These things improve the software  \ndevelopment process.\n\nConclusion\nThe agile software development model is better equipped to handle the technological \npace of our time.

IoT is the vehicle through which the data is sensed, and blockchain creates a \nsafe environment for it to be stored and transferred.\n\nThere are numerous different types of data for which these principles can be applied. In \nthis example, SoftServe used sensors to collect sound data on the loudness of applause \nwhile presenting during the conference itself. In a real-life application, measuring sound and \ncollecting its data could be used to detect the efficiency of equipment in industrial businesses \n(e.g. detecting types and levels of noise within the Large Hadron Collider\u2019s infrastructure, \nmetallurgy, or even mining farms).\n\nProject Description\n\nThe demonstration case put together for the audience at Carnegie Melon was based on \nmeasuring their reaction to different speakers at the conference by analyzing the character \nand noise level of applause in real time. Sensors were placed in different areas inside the \npresenting room.\n\nTo run this specific case, the SoftServe Big Data and IoT team developed our own blockchain \nenvironment to run the interactions among system parties.\n\nThe main parties included in the system are:\n\n \u2022 End users: Those interested in reports that are compiled based on the collected data, \nready to buy the information\n\n \u2022 Sensor gateway: In this specific case sound sensors were used, but any sensors  \ncollecting data\n\n \u2022 Sensors\u2019 owner: The company that operates the sensors\n \u2022 Infrastructure maintenance: A tech support operator\n \u2022 Utilities providers: Outside factors such as electricity, water, etc.\n\nThe system is distributed, and therefore has no central point of authority (independent) nor \nany single point of failure. In the event that any party falls off the interaction, it can easily be \nsubstituted by another at any moment afterwards without losing important data or affecting \nsystem performance for the time of absence.\n\n2case study | Carnegie Mellon: Merging IoT and Blockchain for Smart Report System\n\n\n\nThe interaction process between parties is described in the picture below:\n\nEvery party in this system is an autonomous business unit, able to pay for all interactions \nneeded or services received, and able to get paid for services provided.\n\nThe billing module is also included. Blockchain contracts enforce payment withdrawals and \ntransfers. Sensors collect data from the environment, sell it to the user, and transfer received \npayment to tech support or infrastructure providers to pay for utilities and extra services.  \nThe profit is transferred to the sensors\u2019 owner.\n\nThe main benefit is that system is:\n\n \u2022 Easily scalable\n \u2022 Independent; does not need a central point for maintenance and authority\n \u2022 Resilient in having no single point of failure\n \u2022 Cost efficient\n\n3case study | Carnegie Mellon: Merging IoT and Blockchain for Smart Report System\n\nUser\n\nContract\nOwner\n\nSensors\nOwner\n\nTech\nSupport\n\nReal-time\nDashboard\n\nOperational\nAnalytics\n\nSound Level\nSensors\n\nBlockchain\nContract\n\nInfrastructure\nProviders\n\nSensor\nGateway\n\n\n\nValue Delivered\n\nThe system provides benefits to all involved parties:\n\n \u2022 End User: Gets timely, guaranteed, and transparent data reports without needing to \nmonitor the billing process or manage invoices due to the automated money withdrawal \nvia the smart contracts.\n\n \u2022 Sensors Owner: No need to manage the system performance directly and maintaining \ninfrastructure, easiness of invoicing, guarantee of payments, and ability to scale the \nbusiness easily.\n\n \u2022 Infrastructure/Service Providers: Receive transparent, timely and guaranteed payments \nby smart contracts for services provided.\n\nThe system is developed to fit different types of businesses and customized to fit specific \nclient\u2019s needs.

The \ncompany developed a one-of-a-kind platform for invoice trading, based \non blockchain technology. \n\nTheir mission is connecting people through finance sharing, giving \nentrepreneurs more choices for funding and satisfying investors\nof higher return.\n\nBusiness Challenge\n\nThe client\u2019s product was in the prototype stage when they decided to \npartner with SoftServe to undergo the initial coin offering (ICO) process. \nThe client wanted to run an ICO in order to grow investments in the \nbusiness, increase engagement with the platform, and provide more \nliquidity for investors with future operations at the exchange. \n\n\n\ncase study | Smart Contracts and Security Assessment for Fintech ICO 2\n\nDue to a lack of specialists and development tools for ICO implementation, the demand \nfor knowledgeable specialists greatly exceeds supply. This industry is still young enough \nthat there is simply no infrastructure for working with smart contracts. You have to \nwork with raw material and tools with limited functionality. Having no technical and \norganizational experience the client approached SoftServe to support their ICO initiative \nfrom the tech-consulting and developing expertise standpoint.\n\nOne of the challenges of the project was engaging both bitcoin and ether investors in the \nICO, giving investors with both types of assets in their investment wallets greater liquidity \nand granting also bitcoin investors greater access to alternative finance investments that \npreviously were traded in solely fiat currency.\n\nTaking extra care to ensure investors in the highest level of security within the solution and \nkeeping in mind that smart contracts are inflexible and cannot be changed after release, the \nclient required smart contracts to undergo extra security assessment prior launching live. \n\nProject Description\n\nCooperation with the client in this endeavor covered \u201cturnkey\u201d support with all planned \nICO activities and included following work stacks:\n\nI.   Initial strategic and technical consulting on business case and implementation approach\nII.  Smart contract creation for crowdsale\nIII. Smart contract security assessment\nIV. Bitcoin wallet integration solution for Ethereum\n\nI. Strategic and technical consulting\n\nThe client approached SoftServe with the request to help conduct an ICO. Initial input \nincluded two high-level requirements: to be able to serve bitcoin holders (as investors) \nand to run ICO in Ethereum. \n\nSoftServe conducted a series of workshop sessions to define the main business rules, \nchallenges, and goals of the project. Based on that information, the structure of the deal \nwas refined and the tech approach was clarified. \n\nThe high-level architecture of the developed solution is shown below.\n\n\n\ncase study | Smart Contracts and Security Assessment for Fintech ICO 3\n\nII. Developing smart contracts for ICO\n\nAfter defining the technical structure of conducting the ICO, the smart contracts needed to \nbe created to define the rules for transactions with tokens.\n\nThe emission of tokens had a few stages, including a predefined time for token purchase \n(initial offering), exchanging tokens to tokens, and buying tokens with extra \u201cif\u201d rules (i.e. \nspecial bonuses and discounts as defined by the client).\n\nSmart contracts were written on Solidity, a dynamic programming language constantly \nbeing improved according to the latest updates in smart contract execution practices \nand security issues. \n\nIII. Smart contract security assessment\n\nDue to the specifics of the smart contract, it can\u2019t be validated in a live environment, so no \namendments or improvements can be conducted after deployment. In order to validate the \nquality of the developed smart contracts, SoftServe provided a security assessment service.\n\nAfter the initial local code review, the smart contracts were put in a testing environment to \ndetect any security holes and to mitigate potential risks that might occur when executed in \nthe live environment. Stress tests were conducted with different simulation techniques and \nthe source code was provided to the client after they were passed successfully. \n\n\n\ncase study | Smart Contracts and Security Assessment for Fintech ICO 4\n\nAn external third party was also involved to validate the level of security before deploying the \ncode to live. The validation was passed successfully, and no issues were reported by the client.\n\nIV. Bitcoin wallet integration solution for Ethereum\n\nThe main business requirement, defined by the client, was to enable investors that hold \nprivate bitcoin wallets to have a smooth experience in investing transactions. As Ethereum \noperates with ethers and smart contracts and does not support transactions in bitcoins, a \nsmart approach had to be created.\n\nSoftServe defined the process for this integration, creating a private cabinet for each \ninvestor to take part in purchasing tokens. \n\nThe investor was asked to use an ether wallet for funding transactions or was given a link \nto a newly created personal bitcoin wallet (in case the investor did not have any ether \nwallet, but wanted to invest owned bitcoins to purchase tokens). The investor sent bitcoins \nfrom the personal wallet to the newly created system wallet.\n\nAfter checking the balances of system-created bitcoin wallets, the system transferred \ninvested bitcoins to one central wallet by admin request. Investors\u2019 ether wallets were \ngranted with defined number of tokens. The system web jobs processed requests on \nwhether all ether investors and investors with bitcoin wallets received their tokens properly.   \n\nValue Delivered\n\nSoftServe cooperation with the client was successful - the client\u2019s ICO ran according \nto plan, securely, and involved new investors. Our company was the main partner \nto support the client at their journey with all ICO activities including smart contracts \ndevelopment and security assessment.\n\nTechnology Stack\n\n\u2022 Ethereum as a platform to run smart contracts\n\u2022 Solidity for smart contract implementation\n\u2022 Truffle for compiling and deploying test smart contract\n\u2022 Azure for building, deploying, and managing application for ICO\n\u2022 NBitcoin as a Bitcoin library for the .NET platform\n\u2022 Geth - golang implementation of Ethereum protocol, Ethereum client\n\u2022 Rinkeby as a test network for Ethereum\n\n\n\nUSA HQ\nTel: 1-512-516-8880\nToll free: 866-687-3588\n\nEUROPEAN HQ\nTel: +380-32-240-9090\nToll free: 0-8006-0-8006\n\ninfo@softserveinc.com\nwww.softserveinc.com\n\nABOUT US\nSoftServe is a global digital authority and consulting company, operating \nat the cutting edge of technology.

More precisely, do the artifacts that we\u2014as humans\u2014design \nhave intentionality behind them?\u00a0 \n\nFor years, philosophers have argued that the objects we create are inherently political. \nMeaning that when we design objects with a purpose in mind, that purpose carries a \nspecific intent, whether we realize it or not. Why is that, and what does it mean for the \nfuture of humanizing software? \n\nThe argument is fairly straightforward\u2014we are raised with conscious and unconscious \nbiases, aware or unaware of our own preferences and our own persuasions. \n\nAnd since we are raised with these biases, the output\u2014the \u201cstuff\u201d that we create\u2014\nautomatically inherits those biases. After all, the objects we create come from us. Our \ncreations are laden with politics, whether we realize it or not.\n\nFor example, a table is designed to be of a certain height. It is designed so that a person can \nsit comfortably at the table, perhaps to either eat or work. Sounds straightforward, right?\u00a0 \n\nConsider this: if the designer fails to incorporate the needs of someone who is in a \nwheelchair (i.e. the table is too tall) then the table does not satisfy that individual\u2019s need \nto eat or work at it, and therefore the table is useless. The politics of the table is clear: it \ncannot be universally adopted or used.\u00a0  \u00a0\n\nSo, if physical objects have politics, does that mean software does as well? What about \nthe user experience? How can we be certain that the experiences and interfaces of \ntomorrow will cater to a universal audience?\u00a0 \n\nToday, there are many cases where software has never been more human; increasingly, \nthe line between man and machine is indistinguishable. The machines and interfaces we \nmake take many forms; from smart phones to IoT devices, and are controlled by touch \nscreens, voice commands, gestures, fingerprints, and more. These machines cater to \nmost users\u2014and that isn\u2019t by accident.\u00a0 \n\nPeople are becoming more and more accustomed to the technology that is integrated \ninto their daily routines, whether it\u2019s using voice to check the weather, face recognition \nto unlock a phone, or even pay for services. And this integration becomes seamless with \nsoftware that understands how humans work.\n\n\n\nwhitepaper | What if Software was Human? 3\n\nIt\u2019s already happening. Google\u2019s AutoML system recently broke a record for categorizing \nimages by their content, scoring 82%. In iOS 11, Apple's Siri digital assistant uses layers \nof processing with a neural network that allows iPhones to mimic human speech. And a \nrecent survey from Dell revealed that 82% of respondents predicted humans and robots \nwill work together on teams within the next five years. \n\nBut machines don\u2019t become human-focused overnight. It takes time to infuse empathy \nand to create systems that serve users from all walks of life. We need to take care when \ndeveloping intelligent technology to ensure a human-centered approach.\n\nJust like us?\n\nIntelligent technology is driven by artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML), \nwhich are, in turn, driven by data. These three things drive the ability for humans to \nimprint ourselves on machines. \n\nAI is technology that allows machines to have the same characteristics of human \nintelligence\u2014our ability to sense, reason, and think. \n\nMachine learning is an application of AI based on the idea that we should give machines \naccess to data, parse it, learn from it, and then make a determination or prediction \nabout something in the world. So, rather than write task-oriented software routines with \na specific set of instructions, the machine is \u201ctrained\u201d using large amounts of data and \nalgorithms that give it the ability to learn how to perform the task.\n\nBut the real breakthrough is deep learning and neural networks. \n\nDeep learning is a technique for implementing ML that is able to \u201clearn\u201d patterns from \nlarge amounts of unstructured data. One popular algorithmic approach is neural \nnetworks, a structure that actually imitates the configuration of the human brain. As these \nneural networks process data, the connected web of parts adjusts itself, and enables the \nneural networks to interpret future data. \n\nhttps://www.wired.com/story/googles-learning-software-learns-to-write-learning-software/\nhttps://www.cnet.com/news/apple-ai-machine-learning-makes-siri-sound-human-on-ios-11/\nhttps://www.delltechnologies.com/en-us/perspectives/realizing-2030.htm#link=%7B%22role%22:%22standard%22,%22href%22:%22https://www.delltechnologies.com/en-us/perspectives/realizing-2030.htm%22,%22target%22:%22%22,%22absolute%22:%22%22,%22linkText%\nhttps://www.delltechnologies.com/en-us/perspectives/realizing-2030.htm#link=%7B%22role%22:%22standard%22,%22href%22:%22https://www.delltechnologies.com/en-us/perspectives/realizing-2030.htm%22,%22target%22:%22%22,%22absolute%22:%22%22,%22linkText%\n\n\nwhitepaper | What if Software was Human? 4\n\nBusinesses are becoming more and more creative with regard to how they interact \nwith their customers. So how will you use AI, ML, and experience design to drive your \ncompany into the future?\n\nBy allowing machines to learn about the nuances of human behavior, the machine itself \nis able to respond more effectively to the user. Humans are able to interact in a way that \nfeels natural while being \u201cunderstood\u201d by machines. \n\nBut the interface and overall solution suffer when a human-centered design approach is \nnot taken, ultimately hindering the effectiveness or adoption of the solution itself.  \n\nA truly empathetic approach to experience design will address:\n\n\u2022 The fundamentals of the user experience;\n\u2022 An empathetic, human-centered approach to understand the user;\n\u2022 Applying careful consideration and a deep understanding of who will use it and how;\n\u2022 The value that the product will deliver to the user; and\n\u2022 The relationship between the business and the customer.\n\nDriving business with AI\n\nImagine a sales associate using a smart device to see a customer\u2019s past purchases and \nconcluding which products to offer in-person. Or a healthcare professional receiving a \ndiagnosis and using it to influence a method of care. In these capacities, AI works to aid or \naugment what is ultimately a human decision, speeding the supply of information along.\n\nAI may also be used for intelligent automation, which accelerates decisions without human \nintervention. Imagine providing 24/7 support to customers, going beyond clunky replies to \nrather intelligent beings that can communicate effectively. Imagine using robots that can \nthink for themselves while they fulfill orders, zipping, traffic-free, through warehouses to \naid with shipping. Imagine autonomous cars that you can send to do your shopping, pick \nup a friend, or even use yourself for safer transportation.  \n\nA more human machine using\u2026\n\nVoice\n\nVoice has gone beyond being prompt-driven to comprehending entire exchanges, tones, \nand languages. And customers have taken notice, to the point where voice interfaces \nare regularly used by those who want to be hands-free. According to Gartner, by 2021, \nearly adopter brands that redesign their websites to support visual and voice search will \nincrease digital commerce revenue by 30%.\n\nhttps://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/gartner-top-strategic-predictions-for-2018-and-beyond/\n\n\nwhitepaper | What if Software was Human? 5\n\nVoice commands can be used in any variety of products, from car dashboards to \nheadphones, going beyond Amazon\u2019s Alexa or Apple\u2019s Siri. And voice control is under the \nspotlight as one of the best innovations in the immediate future. Voice interfaces are also \nbeing integrated into the healthcare industry as a way for providers to speak directly to log \nelectronic health records (EHRs), for patients to monitor illness, and as an empowerment \ntool for those who want to live more independently. Voice interfaces can even serve as \npseudo therapists, as in the way of Replika, an AI \u201cfriend\u201d that listens to you.\n\nIoT\n\nAs pervasive as voice interfaces are, IoT devices also make up a large part of the \napplication for human-driven software. \n\nIn many ways, IoT mimics many of the functions of the human body. The cloud being the \n\u201cbrain\u201d and the device being the \u201cbody.\u201d IoT is all about the connectivity of sensors and \nfield devices, connecting physical and digital worlds. \n\nConnected home, personal wearables, and smart cities are only a few of the applications for \nIoT, but they create a foundation for innumerable other products. In fact, Gartner predicts \nthat by 2020, IoT technology will be in 95% of electronics for new product designs. \n\nConnecting devices means more data, which in turn creates more humanistic, personalized \nexperiences for the user. Today, IoT devices can do anything: restock groceries via smart \nrefrigerator, monitor insulin intake via wearable, lock your front door via app, etc. \n\nOther applications\n\nThere\u2019s still a lot of exploration to be done in other interfaces for humanistic software. In \nthe realms of augmented and virtual reality (AR and VR, respectively), most are limited to \nconsidering gaming and entertainment values. However, there is a strong argument to be \nmade for using AR and VR for training programs in intensive professions, like piloting or \nmanaging heavy machinery. There are also possibilities in the world of healthcare, as AR \nand VR are being explored as an avenue for learning to perform surgery.\n\nConclusion\n\nBusinesses need to rise to the occasion of what customers expect, and human-driven \nsoftware and interactions is the new normal. But these systems are incredibly complex, \nand do not always serve each and every user. That\u2019s why a truly human-centered \napproach, that mirrors as many of our behaviors as possible, is needed. In an age when \nvirtually any company can develop a solution, creators need to address these imperatives.\n\nIn the future, machine learning and artificial intelligence might develop software on \nour behalf. We\u2019ll leave it up to the next generation of philosophers to determine if that \nsoftware is human, or not. \n\nhttps://replika.ai/\nhttps://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/gartner-top-strategic-predictions-for-2018-and-beyond/\n\n\nwhitepaper | What if Software was Human? 6\n\nFor now, we as humans continue to blend man and machine, and it is absolutely critical to \nconsider human-centered design from concept to production. \n\nImagine the opportunities that AI and ML will present for your business and ultimately \nfor your customers. But also consider the negative impact of designing without such an \napproach\u2014your software solution or interface could be laden with politics whether you \nrealize it or not. \n\nThe future is now\u2014is your business ready?

The company provides top-quality cash desk hardware \nproducts with a high level of flexibility, such as the most widely used flip top cash \ncassette in Europe and other PoS accessories. \n\nBusiness Challenges\n\nAnker is currently reinventing its existing products to align with the Internet of \nThings. This includes identifying key points and products where such innovations \ncould be achieved. More specifically, the company focuses on reinventing existing \nsolutions for PoS without having to undergo major infrastructure changes for the \nclients.\n\nOne such innovation is a Face Recognition application that could boost the Anker \nPoS product adoption across multiple industries where a single PoS is operated by \nmultiple cashiers.\n\n\n\ncase study |    Facial Recognition Mobile Solution for Anker Point of Sale 2\n\nProject Description\n\nSoftServe\u2019s development of a Face Recognition solution for Anker, began with an \nInnovation Workshop, when a team of our experts visited Anker in Bielefeld, Germany to \nbrainstorm where innovative approaches could be applied. A concept of a Face Recognition \nsolution for the cashier authentication was developed that integrates Anker Cash Cassettes \nhardware with PoS tablets, allowing the register to be unlocked and the cassette opened \nonly by an authorized cashiers. This lead to an increase in productivity over the traditional \nuse of access cards, passwords or simple keys, which could be easily forgotten or lost.\n\nThe developed proof of concept consists of the Face Recognition service running on Google \nCloud Platform (GCP) and a simple iPad application, communicating with the cash cassette \nvia pre-defined protocol, allowing the cashier authorization by face and the cash cassette \nopening once successful. \n\nThe innovative part of this solution is the Face Recognition technology. It allows precise \nidentification of a person which can be used in various contexts and applications. The \napproach is based on the Deep Neural Network and runs on GCP utilizing Vision API \ntoolbox for face detection.\n\nValue Delivered\n\nAs the result of the project, SoftServe delivered a mobile application and the backend \nservice that performs the actual Face Recognition that runs on GCP.\n\nThis solution radically improves productivity of workers who operate with the Point of \nSales. It makes the cashier authorization process more secure by eliminating the need \nin access cards or passwords. It also accelerates the login procedures and reduces idle \ntime if cashiers lose their cards or forgot the password. As well, it reduces possibility for \nunauthorized users to open the cash cassette, providing greater control over access to \nmoney.\n\nThe SoftServe team works as a technical partner to advise Anker on numerous possibilities \nfor innovation and identify a range of use-cases, as well as providing a technical support \nfor the realization of such solutions. \n\n\n\nUSA HQ\n\n201 W 5th Street, Suite 1550\nAustin, TX 75703\n+1 866 687 3588\n\nEUROPEAN HQ\n\nOne Canada Square \nCanary Wharf\nLondon E14 5AB\n+44 (0) 800 302 9436\n\ninfo@softserveinc.com\nwww.softserveinc.com\n\nABOUT US\nSoftServe is a digital authority that advises and provides at the cutting-\nedge of technology.

An examination of recent advancements in patient care and \ncommunications suggests that even more commonplace applications have an equally \npositive impact on the business side of healthcare. \n\nBetween 2011 and 2017, $2.7 billion was raised by health AI and machine learning (ML) \ncompanies, underscoring the interest in this sector. Research estimates that the healthcare \nAI market will grow to more than $7.9 billion by 2022, up from $667.1 million in 2016. These \ninvestments are fueling experimentation and innovation in the ways that AI can transform \nthe science and delivery of healthcare. From robot-assisted surgery and image analysis, \nto personal medical devices and electronic health records (EHR), changes are already in \nmotion.\n\nStarting small has big returns \n\nWhen AI is the topic, the imagination typically jumps to futuristic advancements and \ninnovative cures, but AI-based applications are already delivering substantial savings on \ncommon tasks. A recent investigation found that the value of 10 AI applications could \ngenerate up to $150 billion in annual US healthcare savings by 2026. The majority of these \napplications deal with routine matters such as administrative workflow, dosage error \nreduction, connected machines, fraud detection, and automated image diagnosis. The \nsize of the prize is enormous: an estimated 14% of all waste in healthcare spending\u2014$91 \nbillion\u2014results from inefficient administration alone. AI applications make back-end \nprocesses more efficient, allowing frontline clinicians to be more productive. \n\nDigital communications enabled by smarter AI-enabled technologies have also opened \nmultiple avenues for innovation, from remote healthcare advice, to facilitating online \nappointment requests, delivery of lab and X-ray results, and supporting patient messaging. \nTechnologists at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center developed an application using ML \nto help reduce hospital readmission rates and identify possible no-shows. The application \nallowed the medical center to intervene before treatments lapse, while proactively \npreventing medical fraud\u2014an area of concern that potentially represents billions of dollars \nsaved just from improving speed and accuracy of fraud detection in medical claims. \n\nAnother AI application creating greater efficiency is voice-to-text transcription, which \nimproves workflow by decreasing non-patient care activities such as: writing chart notes, \nrefilling prescriptions, or ordering tests. While the use of EHRs was a major step forward in \nthe digitization of healthcare, it has not been without its challenges. Using AI, developers \nare tackling some of the issues associated with documentation, order entries, and inbox \nsorting that can absorb the majority of a user\u2019s time by creating more intuitive interfaces, \nand automating more routine processes for digital records. \n\nhttps://hbr.org/2018/05/10-promising-ai-applications-in-health-care\nhttps://www.marketsandmarkets.com/Market-Reports/artificial-intelligence-healthcare-market-54679303.html\nhttps://healthitanalytics.com/news/top-12-ways-artificial-intelligence-will-impact-healthcare\nhttps://hbr.org/2018/05/10-promising-ai-applications-in-health-care\nhttps://hbr.org/2018/03/how-ai-is-taking-the-scut-work-out-of-health-care\nhttps://hbr.org/2018/03/how-ai-is-taking-the-scut-work-out-of-health-care\nhttps://hbr.org/2018/05/10-promising-ai-applications-in-health-care\nhttps://healthitanalytics.com/news/top-12-ways-artificial-intelligence-will-impact-healthcare\n\n\nwhitepaper | The Brains Behind Smarter Healthcare 3\n\nAI + ML: A match made in the cloud \n\nThe benefits of efficiency gained by applying AI and ML extend beyond prosaic tasks, and \nwill have a genuine impact on patient care. Computer-assisted physician documentation \nhelps care providers cut down on documentation time and upgrade reporting quality. \nIt can also improve real-time clinical care by ensuring that patients receive an accurate \nclinical history and consistent recommendations. \n\nCollaborators are seeking to quickly and accurately analyze thousands of data points \nto improve both personalized and broader population care, mining big data from EHRs, \nadministrative claims, and medical research using cognitive computing capabilities. This \nsame data also informs surgical procedures and can impact decisions about care by \nanalyzing long-term patterns that might be overlooked when making decisions on-the-go. \n\nBy analyzing data from pre-op medical records, AI-assisted robots can physically guide a \nsurgeon\u2019s instrument, with fewer complications and errors reported in AI-assisted robotic \nsurgery. If applied properly, there is the potential to generate a 21% reduction in patients\u2019 \nlength of stay post-op, simply due to the increased accuracy. \n\nA human touch (almost) \n\nThe application of AI technology is not confined to the office or operating room. \nIncreasingly, individual patients are practical beneficiaries. Consider the AI-powered \nvirtual nursing assistant, perhaps one of the more novel examples of \u201coutsourced\u201d care \nvia an AI application. These nursing assistants interact with patients, ask questions about \nhealth, assess symptoms, and connect patients and care providers between office visits \nto reduce or prevent hospital readmissions. One estimate finds that AI-powered nurse \nassistants could save nurses the 20% of their time that is spent on patient maintenance \ntasks, translating into $20 billion in annual savings. Virtual assistants can also help ease the \nburden of nursing shortages. \n\nPatients are increasingly able to monitor their status and communicate with their \nhealthcare providers or with virtual care chatbots. One area that has particularly \nbenefitted is the treatment of diabetes, where several advanced applications provide \n\nhttps://www.nuance.com/healthcare/artificial-intelligence.html\nhttps://newsroom.clevelandclinic.org/2016/12/22/cleveland-clinic-ibm-collaborate-establish-model-cognitive-population-health-management-data-driven-personalized-healthcare/\nhttps://hbr.org/2018/05/10-promising-ai-applications-in-health-care\nhttps://healthitanalytics.com/news/top-12-ways-artificial-intelligence-will-impact-healthcare\nhttps://hbr.org/2018/05/10-promising-ai-applications-in-health-care\nhttps://venturebeat.com/2018/04/22/the-3-most-valuable-applications-of-ai-in-health-care/\nhttps://venturebeat.com/2018/04/22/the-3-most-valuable-applications-of-ai-in-health-care/\nhttps://syneoshealthcommunications.com/perspectives/talk-healthy-to-me\n\n\nwhitepaper | The Brains Behind Smarter Healthcare 4\n\nvirtual coaches delivering context-dependent, mood-sensitive, and emotionally aware \neducation and guidance.

The hope is that \nby analyzing these sensor readings, individuals who start to show signs related to various \nmedical issues would receive notifications or reminders for treatment much sooner. \n\nLook before you leap \n\nDespite the anticipation and excitement generated by AI advancements, there are \nchallenges that need to be addressed. \n\nLegacy integration \n\nDevelopers and providers need to be attentive to the personal side of healthcare, the \naccuracy of collected data being analyzed, and the compatibility and integration across \nvarious platforms. Some who have been in the healthcare space for years may be suddenly \nconfronted with a wide range of legacy healthcare applications that vary in design, \nfunctionality, and performance. To truly optimize and streamline, disparate systems may \nhave to be brought into one centralized, convenient, and functional platform\u2014a complex \nchallenge. \n\nSecurity \n\nThe security and accuracy of recorded data are of paramount importance when it comes \nto connecting and transmitting highly personal information. Data provides the basis for \nmedical progress, contributes to advancements, and informs researchers, providers, and \ncaretakers. All of this material comes from individuals whose privacy and rights need to be \nbalanced with the desire to accumulate information in the name of progress. \n\nQuality assurance \n\nReported or recorded health data may not always be accurate, and it can be a challenge \nto eliminate inconsistencies or skewed reports. Remove as many barriers to personal \nreporting as possible through user-friendly interfaces, and background capture of data \nthat eliminates human reporting, and secure systems. \n\nSoftServe delivers complex, integrated applications\u2014driven by AI and the quality data \nit relies on\u2014while ensuring adherence to privacy regulations and requirements.

The company creates and deploys software solutions that \nreduce cost, mitigate risk, and improve service delivery throughout the IT lifecycle. The \nclient provides comprehensive solutions including: \n\n\u2022 Metadata and content management\n\u2022 Systems solutions\u2014a wide variety of products including performance management, \n\nworkload automation, application management, and service quality and control.\n\n\n\ncase study |   Data intelligence\u2014scanners developed to gather metadata from various tools 2\n\nBusiness Challenge\n\nDuring the client\u2019s product evolution, the amount of data used and provided grew \ndramatically. As a result, the data became cumbersome and unmanageable\u2014it was time \nconsuming to get it into a usable format.\n\n\u2022 Data lakes contain a huge variety of information. The type, creation date, owner, \ninitial size, etc. could be determined. However, the data was so complex that analyzing \nseparate chunks while ignoring  the relationship between it did not give the complete \npicture.\n\n\u2022 Even if the data was quickly found and analyzed and then put in the proper context, it \nwas still probable the data was inconsistent\u2014caused by its mutability. With time some \ndependencies between the data elements disappeared making the data useless.\n\nProject Description\n\nThe client collaborated with SoftServe to develop scanners to gather metadata from \nvarious tools\u2014Hive, HDFS, Falcon, Flume, Sqoop\u2014used for transformations, migrations, \nand storing data in Apache Hadoop.\n\nThe scanners could gather metadata using REST or Java API and then transform the data \ninto a specific format for the metadata repository. Also, the scanners created links between \nmetadata items in the metadata repository scanned from different tools. All scanned, \nimported, and linked data was used for further analytical processes and lineage creation.\n\nValue Delivered\n\nAs a result of the collaboration, the client received the following value:\n\n\u2022 X-platform. Scanners developed by SoftServe gathered metadata from Apache \nHadoop framework components enabling compatibility with the most popular Hadoop \ndistributions\u2014Cloudera, Hortonworks, IBM BigInsights, and Talend Studio.\n\n\u2022 Modular. Each scanner is a standalone application and can be used separately or in \ncombination with other tools. This approach allowed our client to select the exact tool \ncombination for their needs and guaranteed time and money savings.\n\n\u2022 Flexible. Scanners produced structured data output (XML) so various programming \nlanguages could be used for additional data processing\u2014analyzing, reconstructing \nrelationships, and visualizing the metadata structure and lineage.\n\n\n\nABOUT US\nSoftServe is a digital authority that advises and provides at the \ncutting-edge of technology.
